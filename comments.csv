AMOLED is such a improvement, not just for gamers, but for everyday users alike due to much better color saturation and deeper blacks. The 90Hz also helps. \n\nPerformance wise, the 128GB base storage option is very nice, the chipset ain't going to impress everyone, but its good enough for simple gaming and everyday browsing. \n\nDesign wise, its nice and cool for most people. \n\nThe only thing that turns people away from it is speakers and video, the speaker isn't great, dual speakers is great for music and the fact its capped on 30 fps 1080p video is upsetting. I mean i don't hate the fact that its resolution is 1080p, its just if your going to cap it on FHD, At least give a 60 fps option. \n\nFor the price, its a very good value phone, and will still hold up in the future (Especially compared to the A05)""}","{'video_id': 'fFCGtAmse5c', 'comment': 'Another great vid Wade!\n\nThis is such an awesome value...

Além disso, a bateria do relógio está descarregando muito mais rápido do que deveria e o sistema operacional ficou bastante lento.\n\nComprei o aparelho há menos de seis meses, portanto acredito que ele ainda esteja na garantia. Entrei em contato com o suporte oficial da Samsung, mas infelizmente fui ignorado.\n\nGostaria que a Samsung resolvesse esses problemas, seja através do conserto do aparelho ou da troca por um novo que funcione corretamente, sem problemas de superaquecimento, bateria e lentidão.

I'm not talking about just the cleaning tool to release memory in the settings menu.  You should tap on each app after using it and hit the app info interactive i with the circle around it then go to storage and cache then clear cache.  This is something you've always needed to do in every android phone no matter the processor or RAM to ensure the apps run well.  This is one of those common sense things that any android user should know and do but most people don't do this and it helps your device.\n\n-If you've done the other things on this list the only other thing you can do to aid better performance is to wipe your cache partition.  Again, if you don't know how to Google it or look it up on a YouTube video.  \n\n-One final tip is to regularly restart your phone.  This releases used memory and will help the phone to run at its peak performance.  You don't have to restart your phone every day but anywhere from once every couple days to a couple times per week is ideal.\n\nI hope this helps anyone that experiences slow performance and you'd be surprised how doing these things helps even the most laggy phones.""}","{'video_id': '6NBH0KLLe9s', 'comment': 'Thanks for making the review.'}","{'video_id': '6NBH0KLLe9s', 'comment': 'Excellent review!'}","{'video_id': '6NBH0KLLe9s', 'comment': 'this was a really in depth review and it is very informative thank you so much:)'}","{'video_id': '6NBH0KLLe9s', 'comment': ""I got this phone.

My gf and I both use very outdated phones, I still use my ORIGINAL LG Aristo, how old is that, lol!!!!  But I'm finding some apps will not work with my non-upgradeable operating system (Android 7)!  My gf also lives part of the year in Ecuador, part of the year here, and she needs an updated phone too!  So I just ordered two of these on Amazon, 256gb/8gb ram, for $179 each, one for me and one for her.  Big benefit for her is it's already unlocked, and dual sim slots means she can have her EC sim in one slot, her US sim in the other slot, either one ready to use whether she's here or there!  Am I right about that?  Thanks again for, in my mind, confirming my choice of this phone!""}","{'video_id': '6NBH0KLLe9s', 'comment': ""Thanks alot for this great video,it really helped.I've ordered mine should get it next week.""}","{'video_id': '6NBH0KLLe9s', 'comment': 'Nice it has headphone jack'}","{'video_id': '6NBH0KLLe9s', 'comment': 'I went to a phone store today to check out the 2024 Samsung Galaxy A15 5G.\nI opened up six apps on the phone numerous times.
