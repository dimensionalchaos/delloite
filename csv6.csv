32EeGI4hyTc,Do you think the A15 is a worthy upgrade?
32EeGI4hyTc,"the A15 is the first A1x device to be getting 4os updates with an additional year of security patches, so 5 years of software support!"
32EeGI4hyTc,"the fact that nowadays you can get an amoled display with 90hz in a low-end phone without sacrificing too much the camera and the hardware departments, is crazy to me"
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing❤
The A15 is the pick for me💯"
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing - Thank you for the clear and quick review. DEFINITELY made my decision easier. I NEVER comment on videos but I've never found a review as ""layman friendly"""

32EeGI4hyTc,"Guys trust me it is worth it i bought the a14 when it was released it did have some small lags, not very smooth scrolling and display,very slow charging. 
I bought the a15 two days ago i noticed a very big difference animation, scrolling, fast charging, better colors but dont buy the 4gb ram version buy 6 or 8"

32EeGI4hyTc,This is amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,Awesome
32EeGI4hyTc,can you do this?samsung a15 vs  s 10 ?
32EeGI4hyTc,The galaxy a05s has a snapdragon 680 and this device the helio g99. Who is better for you?
32EeGI4hyTc,I have the A14 it an its really nice i had a A04 before
32EeGI4hyTc,Amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,Ery helpful. Rh !
32EeGI4hyTc,The Samsung Galaxy A1x series is very good this year...
32EeGI4hyTc,Yes it is worth an upgrade
32EeGI4hyTc,I'm keeping my Samsung A24
32EeGI4hyTc,"I don’t know if one ui 6 will have a core version

Maybe they will scrap the core version"
32EeGI4hyTc,Amaxing
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing.

A15 is definitely better."
32EeGI4hyTc,the video sound of the A14 is notorious of being bad... is the A15 any better.
32EeGI4hyTc,Which is fater between the A15 & the A15 5G
32EeGI4hyTc,how much better is a14 batt life? minutes? hours?
32EeGI4hyTc,"The display is a big upgrade. However, the entire phone is a bit smaller, and though there is a new processor, performance will still be virtually the same. If they continue this AMOLED trend, then I will really consider the A16.

-An A14 user"
32EeGI4hyTc,Although the A15 has an amoled display it's resolution and pixel density is inferior to the A 14. Having looked at both side by side the 14 has a sharper display so to my eyes the amoled display is pointless !
32EeGI4hyTc,Lover your videos Oscar 👏
32EeGI4hyTc,"I prefer narrower a14 display, ascpect ratio, a15 good spec, but they shouldnt had changed aspect ratio"
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 is now A24 the specs are identically .😂
32EeGI4hyTc,a15 or redmi note 12 ?
32EeGI4hyTc,are these 5g or 4g?
32EeGI4hyTc,i have galaxy a14.... it does have the 90hz refresh rate
32EeGI4hyTc,"Damm bro tysm!
I wanted to buy a new phone and i was thinking about the A14 or the A15.
And now I know which one to buy thanks to you! :D

P.S. W for doing the camera test. It helped me A LOT!!!"
32EeGI4hyTc,Am I the only one who prefers the Infinity V on the A14?
32EeGI4hyTc,But AMOLEDs are susceptible to green lines and led burns.
32EeGI4hyTc,Can I get a phone😢?....I know u have more than enough for urself
32EeGI4hyTc,Resolution is fhd+ not hd+
32EeGI4hyTc,"The A14 was 60 bucks QVC Tracphone ,I now Have 3,400 Minutes Phone and5000 texts  ,Buy New every Year and Transfer minutes, No monthly.."
32EeGI4hyTc,But how much is it in retail price
32EeGI4hyTc,Me watching this video on my redmi 13c no overheating or lagging redmi do all
32EeGI4hyTc,Yap all things being equal
32EeGI4hyTc,I like you 😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
32EeGI4hyTc,You see that notch they need to drop it I literally got an Infinix because of that notch is ugly. They should introduce punch hole to the low budget a series
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 ❤
32EeGI4hyTc,Am going to change my phone now
32EeGI4hyTc,"But a14 😂 is good yoh..its just fighting with processing power for pictures, but if you check the videos, it's leading my guy.."
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 is more better
32EeGI4hyTc,How much A15 ????
32EeGI4hyTc,Actually the A15 is FHD+ not HD+
32EeGI4hyTc,A14 5g is $80 for me
32EeGI4hyTc,Got tthe a14 for 75 out the door
32EeGI4hyTc,😅 Amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,the a15 looks okay from the front and the a14 is just ugly as hell
32EeGI4hyTc,Realme gt6 is far beetter than these two
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 only work with one sim
