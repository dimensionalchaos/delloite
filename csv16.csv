iso6qgCo6vI,"I'm a 73 yr old woman getting my first smartphone.  I've been feeling a little fearful and overwhelmed with the technology.  I wouldn't even know how to turn it on.  Thank you so much for a clear, easily understandable training.  I'm feeling a lot more confident about the phone arriving on Monday."
iso6qgCo6vI,You have changed my world with this video! Thank you for clear and understandable instructions for us older folks
iso6qgCo6vI,Outstanding!  A non-tech-savvy family member just bought one of these phones and I have had my hands full trying to explain to him how his phone works.  This video is a perfect introduction to the A15.
iso6qgCo6vI,"I am a 76 years young man. I find the step by step explanatory instructions on the  videos so clear to understand. Wayne, conveys information in a well articulated manner. Thank you so much.     Yvan"
iso6qgCo6vI,"FINALLY!!!!!  GREAT VIDEO FOR 80 YEAR OLD LADIES!!!!  NICE AND PATIENT, NO ""SALAD LANGUAGE"".  SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS!  THIS NEW PHONE HAS BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS.  THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH.  I'LL BE LOOKING FOR MORE FROM YOU."
iso6qgCo6vI,"Very nice presentation for beginners and old farts. I'm an old fart, and these phones scare me. You made me so comfortable with my new A15 . I had an older version Galaxy J7, and only did the basics with it. I feel more at home when I pick it up now. your video gets 2 thumbs up for clarity and complete explanations for what you covered. Thanks"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks Wayne!  Just got this phone today - an upgrade from my Samsung A11.  It's pretty similar but your tutorial is appreciated!  Oh, I am really looking forward to you explaining how to put in a 4 digit security password!  Great stuff, Wayne!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"When it comes to cell phones, you can't find anyone more green at it.  I literally knew zip; however, your style in explaining is excellent, easy to understand, and done at a pace where learning takes place more easily.  Many kudos to you.  I look forward to the next video.  Now I feel much less frustrated in that I'm starting to get it!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for making this phone easy to understand, Just changed from years of Flip phones, have been afraid to make the change, Great Video."
iso6qgCo6vI,I LOVED ALL OF IT. I JUST GOT THE PHONE HAVING AN LG IN THE PAST FROM 9 YEARS AGO. YOU ARE AWESOME. I COULD NOT HAVE GOT THIS INFO IN THE STORE
iso6qgCo6vI,I have been waiting for such type of information for a long time . I am satisfied .Very kind of you. Thanks.
iso6qgCo6vI,At last-a great presentation for us older folks without silly music and clear speech.Well done!(England).
iso6qgCo6vI,"I have never had a Samsung, my mom just bought this phone and I sent her this tutorial and she can actually follow it!! You really out here helping people so much. And not being condescending or making people feel stupid. Thank You😃"
iso6qgCo6vI,"How to make a call at 24:02!  So many of these ""basic"" videos assume we already know that.  I'm 78  and this is my first cell phone of any kind.  As AT&T cut my landline off I was home alone with no way to call 911 in an emergency.  Now I can!  Thank you!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"After updating from a phone that was 7-9 years old, this was very valuable. Well presented !"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so much for the video.  The section on how to add a different email was my absolute favorite, I now have my email on my phone, very pleased!"
iso6qgCo6vI,I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy. I am a senior citizen and this video was very informative. I thank you very much. I will be watching more of your videos.
iso6qgCo6vI,That whole thing was AWESOME!! Thank u so much.  At 88 going from Galaxy 6 to A15 I really needed lots of help.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you very much indeed for such a great presentation.   Very easy to understand and I can now do everything on my new A15  (at the age of 81 years!)     You are a brilliant tutor!   From Herefordshire, England."
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you very much. Brilliant video for a technophobe like me!
iso6qgCo6vI,"This video for the phone I just bought was a life saver!  Am elderly and very tech challenged!  Tried the first video by someone else and immediately turned it off.  Then I found your video.  Easy to understand and pause, as needed.  I highly recommend this video.  Liked and subscribed.  Going to watch all of your videos that pertain to my Samsung Galaxy 15.  Was seriously about to turn in and pay the restocking fee to get rid of the phone.  With your help, am going to be able to maneuver the phone and do everything I need to do!  Thank you so much!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for explaining this well.  Some of it is over my head, and I can only do a little at a time.  I have had this phone for about a month and was so happy when I found your video!  There’s so much I don’t know how to do.  I’ll keep listening.  I may have to play this a few times,  but am grateful you made it.  ❤

My gripe is the lady at the T-Mobile store was mean.  She made me cry and feel so stupid I just got my stuff and left.  T-Mobile, however, responded quickly and so caringly — they are not going to bill me till December because the woman was so mean, and they said they don’t tolerate that — especially being so nasty to a 25-year customer.  Good service from T-Mobile!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"fANTASTIC vIDEO , thank you very very much.
I am 80 years old ans still learning.!!!
Looking forward to your next videos.
Thank you once again."
iso6qgCo6vI,"Well done mate, good job. Thank You !!!"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thankyou for making it nice & clear for us Oldies will be setting my A15 up tomorrow!
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks! Just got this phone today to replace my iPhone 6 that went a little crazy. Your video is EXACTLY what is needed for older folks that don't have their heads up their phone 24/7 need to understand and adapt quickly to the basic functions and navigation of this phone. I am off to a great start and already feel more comfortable with this Samsung than I do with any of my Apple devices,thanks to your great tutelage."
iso6qgCo6vI,Huge thanks - after charging up my phone I was clueless how to even switch it on and thank goodness for your video - I'm at 30 mins and will continue the rest tomorrow - amazingly helpful! 😁

iso6qgCo6vI,"This video was well explained. Just got this phone, so I am starting from scratch, from a Flip Phone. Big difference  with so much to learn."

iso6qgCo6vI,"Mate - I'm only half way through this video.... THANK YOU!!!! Great guidance. I have friends who ""clicki de click - clack - its fixed!"" but thats not the same as learning for yourself. Thanks, fella. this video sorted out a lot of problems."
iso6qgCo6vI,"I too am an old fart, ploughing through 150 pages made my head spin,but you have made it so simple ,thank you"
iso6qgCo6vI,I like the way you teach and model step by step the navigation process on the phone. It was very helpful so that I can show it to my beginning cell buyers and they need to know basically the fundamentals and navigation of using a cell phone.
iso6qgCo6vI,Thanks a heap Bud - just bought this today. Exactly what I needed. Clear and concise. Have subscribed.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so very much for this great video!!! I just bought this phone today and by watching you run through so many functions, I feel like I might just know what I am doing with it, even after just a few hours of owning it. YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you, thank you, and thank you!!! You explained nav'ing the phone so well! I'm a lot more confident using this ""thing"" now."

iso6qgCo6vI,"2 issues I have with my A15.
the first is the size of the bubble when texting.  I've read that there is no way to enlarge this at all in the vertical mode in order to see more than 4 lines of text and edit them.  The only recommendation was to go landscape in order to get a wider bubble, which is still only 4 lines though.  Is there another way?
Next, and this could just be an issue with the app, but using the GPS which I do often, I get a text or email that I want/need to look at but the controls for the app only shrink it but it still covers up a lot of my messages even though I can move it around.  The ""home screen button"" just isn't there.  Suggestions?"
iso6qgCo6vI,Very informative. Thanks
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you so frustrating after watching twenty videos that only told me to power phone off(didn’t help) your tip to remove battery worked
iso6qgCo6vI,EXCELLENT tutorial. THX!
iso6qgCo6vI,Great details thanks love the video.❤

iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you for your great tutorial.💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
iso6qgCo6vI,"Ditto everyone else.
Thank you"
iso6qgCo6vI,It actually worked ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,"Great video, very handy.  But as a first time cellphone owner, it may seem pretty basic, but when I just got it, no sim in it and no clue about setting up an account or service (I was advised to use public mobile) and I am fairly clueless about sims, though I do understand them a little bit.  Something for the absolute newbie, covering getting a sim, getting a service to use etc... would be helpful.  I noticed a lot of videos online assume you already have a sim and service, but I haven't found any to cover if you do not (I am on a computer presently).  I assume it is fairly straight forward and simple, but not when you don't know anything about these.  Thanks."
iso6qgCo6vI,"I buy this today for 13,990. Your video help me a lot .am 57 year old.you educate me how to use cel..thank you so much. i subscribe"
iso6qgCo6vI,"I've always had a S Galaxy & the button's, ( volume, etc,etc) on the left side. It's driving me nuts that they switched  side. And always swiped down from the top, not up. Swiping from the homescreen, which should be set to easy mode for us older folks. I hope there is one Ui home. You've certainly covered in depth, which can get confusing. I just hit the button on the homescreen that is  all the apps & all your apps come up like pages in a book. This swiping up is very confusing. I don't mind turning the pages, so to speak. For older people we need things that are easy & also picking the accessibility for font, style of, magnifier for older people. Changing to dark mode. I've never been able to pick up my phone & talk. I always use speaker function. The first thing I wish I could do is get Google off my phone. I use Firefox for my browser. Google takes over everything, including my Gallery. They ruined my photos now, separating them into albums, etc,etc.
Whatever I do is stay away from Google. Of course, Google won't leave you alone. Firefox protects you, Google sells all your information. Well, now you're getting into the font size 😂.  Thank You"
iso6qgCo6vI,"I found this very informative and I thank you for it. I noticed when you were explaining voice text you did not use any punctuation. I’m having a major problem with voice texting because the system is spelling out the characters. ,?! Are being spelled out. How do we fix this? I appreciate your response. Thanks."
iso6qgCo6vI,Great video!!! What I am having trouble with...new phone....is screenshots. I found how to take them but seems very awkward. Maybe you'd have a tip for that some time! Thanks for this tutorial!
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you for the everything it was all helpful. How to save a new phone number?
iso6qgCo6vI,I have a Motorola phone that i don't like.  Looking forward to getting this phone and going back to Samsung.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Very patient, very clear."
iso6qgCo6vI,Excellent tutorial   👍
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks so much for the help! Really appreciate it. I'm still confused about how to set up SMS Messenger as default and why I should set up that one versus the existing red text. When I press set up as default button nothing happens. Also I'd love to know how I can move over my notes from notes app from old droid to new droid  rather than manually having to type them in. If you have other resources or ever decide to do video on these topics please let me know, but really GREAT video. I also LOVE that they have captions so if there's a topic that I need to focus on I can scan right to it. Thanks for your service. 😇"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you! you helped a lot. Now I don't have to ask my kids or grand kids to set it up. I'm pleased
iso6qgCo6vI,"Very nice video 
Tnx so much Bro"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Wayne, when you say the phone is ""asleep"" and accordingly still ON,  that suggests to me it is still using power and therefore draining the battery.  Would it therefore not be a better idea to turn it off completely to prevent this happening?"
