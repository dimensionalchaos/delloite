XaqOejIaFgM,"Not that you’re ever overly negative in your reviews but I think this is the most glowing review I’ve seen you make over the years.

XaqOejIaFgM,Man hearing Marques give such an overwhelmingly positive review of a Samsung phone feels like a rarity. Glad i waited for this phone! Nice review as always!,2024-01-26T22:21:45Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,Thanks for the review mate. Just ordered the 24 Ultra. I'm using my phone more and more these days for youtube so it's good to see these camera improvements and also durability 👍,2024-01-27T02:55:44Z,2024-01-27

XaqOejIaFgM,Damn that’s crazy you still do phone reviews I used to watch when I was little ‼️I appreciate you,2024-09-27T02:00:36Z,2024-09-27
XaqOejIaFgM,In my 8+ years of being your subscriber maybe this is the 1st video where you were praising the product soo much and i loved it all the way.,2024-01-27T05:38:34Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"For me, its the corners. I love the sharp corners of the ultra line. It's so pretty.",2024-06-02T20:01:05Z,2024-06-02
XaqOejIaFgM,I came back to this video now that I have finally converted from iphone 14 pro max to the S24 ultra. Not gonna lie this change was worth it. The phone is so stinking good. I'm loving it WAY more then ANY apple i've ever owned. I was apple since the 4.,2024-07-16T04:23:44Z,2024-07-16
XaqOejIaFgM,S24 Ultra look more PREMIUM than S25 Ultra...!,2025-02-24T12:35:23Z,2025-02-24
XaqOejIaFgM,"You basically just confirmed all the reasons I've been buying the Note and now the S Ultra series phones from Samsung. They're not cheap, but the amount of things on tap that are done either extremely well or well enough that it all adds up being worth the cost to me. Also, as an artist and someone who likes to handwrite, the SPen is incredibly useful and fun. No other phone even has this feature close to this level of refinement so I'd honestly buy the phone just for that if I had to.",2024-01-27T03:42:24Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,Absolute monster of a phone.  Mine just arrived mid-January.  Owned Samsung from almost the beginning of Smartphones.  I also always loved windows integration on Android phones that you plug your phone into computer and it shows as a normal extra drive.. still exploring all ai features...,2024-01-27T02:09:13Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,9:27 Yes! It would be great if you could give us an analysis of how Google and Samsung are competing against each other and Apple at the same time.,2024-01-29T17:22:02Z,2024-01-29
XaqOejIaFgM,"Going back here after watching his video about the best phone of 2024. 
It comes full circle as mentioned in 0:28 that this phone sets the tone for 2024.

I hope my S24U really is going to be my reliable phone for the next 6 years. And I hope yours, too.",2024-12-20T14:05:50Z,2024-12-20
XaqOejIaFgM,"I'm not even a phone person, but I keep watching your videos only because MKBHD videos are really really well-presented, with a great personality.",2024-01-27T07:15:21Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,Kudos to Samsung for getting rid of curved screen on their ultra model.  Samsung has cone a long way in terms of software.  I recall the touchwiz days. Literally had to flash custom rooms like Cyanogen mods. Only thing I miss from old phones are the removable batteries and expandable storage.,2024-01-27T00:19:50Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,I can spend 1300$ on an S24 and iPhone users would still call me broke for preferring an Android.,2024-07-08T20:33:51Z,2024-07-08

XaqOejIaFgM,I am here because i want to feel good for the 1300$ i spent,2024-09-22T14:12:20Z,2024-09-22
XaqOejIaFgM,"I've had the S8 forever and last night my phone's charging port finally gave up. I got it fixed, but because I was eligible for an upgrade, I bought an S24 Ultra today, largely due to how you meticulously broke down the phone's specs and because of your glowing review. Thanks for the thorough review!",2024-03-31T06:37:59Z,2024-03-31
XaqOejIaFgM,I did it!.... Finally got it 😢,2025-04-08T16:57:52Z,2025-04-08
XaqOejIaFgM,"These reviews are genuinely next-level. Great work as always, Marques!",2024-01-26T21:46:58Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,Worth the wait. I hate that other tech reviewers rushed their so called “review” just for the views while taking advantage of the buzz created by Samsung. I like that MKBHD took his time to give us real and quality “review”. There’s levels to this and I can say MKBHD is at the top.,2024-01-26T23:26:48Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,Marques just makes every damn phone look so good in every shot. Makes me wanna buy all of them 😂,2024-01-27T11:50:46Z,2024-01-27

XaqOejIaFgM,"I went from a S10 to the S22 ultra. I've had the S22 for two years and it is still the best phone I have ever experienced. I'll be upgrading to the S24 ultra this year partly because of this review. I TRUST your reviews and I know you're going to be honest, good or bad. Thank you!!",2024-01-26T23:23:52Z,2024-01-26

XaqOejIaFgM,The whole live translation thing is honestly the most impressive bit of technology ive seen in a long time and i love the tech world. Having my phone be able to live translate a conversation im having was something i dreamed of as a kid and saw in spy movies and shows. Crazy that it was just a feature added to galaxy phones with the most recent software update,2024-06-01T01:56:17Z,2024-06-01
XaqOejIaFgM,"I love that you change the literal aesthetic of the video when you went to aesthetics section of photography. Production is always on-point, but sometimes I just have to shake my head and smile. Well played, MKBHD, well played...",2024-02-02T14:23:29Z,2024-02-02
XaqOejIaFgM,Ive had my S23+ for a year and i had switched from my iPhone XR. Boy I never see myself switching back. These new Samsung's are absolute beasts!,2024-03-25T06:02:11Z,2024-03-25
XaqOejIaFgM,Just managed to upgrade to s24 ultra today. Glad I made the right decision 😂,2025-03-19T18:58:36Z,2025-03-19
XaqOejIaFgM,One note: the save as sticker feature in Samsung gallery has been available on older phones. I have a galaxy S22 and I've got that feature.,2024-01-27T11:39:33Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"7 years with updates! Well done Samsung! 👏 Phones are so good and expensive now, that it makes sence giving the buyer a reassuring feeling.",2024-01-30T20:05:25Z,2024-01-30
XaqOejIaFgM,"I have s24 ultra and iphone 15 pro, and I noticed I like using s24 ultra more, the screen is so great for watching videos and reading ebooks, and the new AR coating is fantastic, it feels like reading a ereader.",2024-05-02T17:11:02Z,2024-05-02
XaqOejIaFgM,"Update on the S24 Ultra vs S25 Ultra

S24 Ultra
- Box Style shape (Just like the original note series)
- S24 Ultra first flat screen with eligant curved frame gives premium style (Flat screen protector frienldy)
- Brightness was tested as ive seen and notice is brighter. (Coating or what not probably causing this but the anti reflection is nearly identical)
- S-Pen bluetooth (Gimick or useful but still very nice knowing you have some inspector gadget type tech in your pocket if needed)
- One UI 7 Update for the S24U has some new video exporting blowing away the non optimized version of the S25 U as seen and tested.
- Camera rings are solid and premium (Flush no potential removal)
- 7 years of update (S24U) and was originally advertised as the AI phone already (I use all the AI features Minus the Now brief on the S25 Ultra i had it turned off)
- S-pen location on the S24 Ultra is in a perfect spot for cases (S25 Ultra seems to have it in a odd location where its curved so all the cases have a nasty open cutout in the corner)

S25 Ultra
- Feels like an Iphone which i always envyed iphone users having a flat square display but the samsung design lost its touch reminds me of the redmagic phone (not Note shape)
- Faster CPU but samsung is behind updating a more optimized version for the S25 Ultra
- Nearly only one year extra of uptades vs the S24 U 
- Extra pixels in one camera (I dont see the difference)
- Blue tooth 5.4 vs 5.3 (Dont notice much maybe the 6.0 will be a bigger upgrade.


Conclusion:
Sending my S25 Ultra back and will continue to use the S24 Ultra (I will snag a new one when they come back to the Note roots i have  under 7 years not in a hurry but ill cross my fingers on this one)",2025-06-07T02:53:00Z,2025-06-07
XaqOejIaFgM,"One thing I noticed is the battery management is absolutely amazing. Where I would run out 15% of my battery, I now run 1-2% max, it's actually insane...
Yes my S21 Ultra was getting old and I used it A LOT, so the battery would have been losing efficiency. But my god, that's 7x+ on the top end, I don't think i've ever had that experience when i've upgraded, and i've gone
S2 > S4 > S7 Edge > S9 Plus > S21 Ultra > Now this.
Not a single one of those upgrades gave me this battery efficiency.",2024-06-01T19:20:57Z,2024-06-01
XaqOejIaFgM,"Thank you for this review, even though I can argue that many people actually like smaller phones at the end of the day.
I have tested the smaller S24 on my channel running the new Exynos, Temps, and Battery drain, and I dare to say that even the base variants this year is impressive, Feel free to check out the numbers for yourself.",2024-01-27T03:47:08Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,Was about to pre order the iphone 16 pro max (Had a iphone 15 pro max) watched all the videos on it saw there was minor additions. Started looking into the samsung 24 ultra immediatly bought it. Sold my 15 pro max and my Mac Mini (8gbram  256 storage) at a local mac reseller store for 1300$ cash ordered my samsung online for 999.99 took the profit got a portable monitor 4k 120hz 15.6 in and a full size bluetooth keyboard for Dex. NEVER turning back !,2024-09-14T12:31:19Z,2024-09-14
XaqOejIaFgM,"this phone almost 1 year old and still the best performing phone in the market !! a lot of phones came out after it and they couldnt beat it, respect for samsung",2025-01-03T15:16:10Z,2025-01-03
XaqOejIaFgM,"This phone has all the right boxes ticked out , it's definitely going to be a hit for anyone and everyone who can afford it",2024-01-27T08:22:44Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,moving the car in the photo blew my mind. and that fill in the space. wow!,2024-01-27T15:45:26Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"I am a Pixel 8 Pro user and when S24 dropped and I saw all the AI features,  the first thing I felt was as if this was a Pixel phone on a Samsung Hardware. I was surprised that nobody really mentioned about in the first impression videos! Happy to know that you felt it. Would love to see a video on how Google and Samsung is coming together. Throwback to the Nexus days!",2024-01-27T12:40:34Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"I'm glad I got the s24 ultra, the s25 ultra losing Bluetooth, not upgrading to a 1 inch sensor for the main cam, not upgrading the 3x telephoto and just the ultrawide lol Samsung got really greedy. if this is the direction Samsung is going, this could be my last Samsung phone the s24 ultra.",2025-01-29T04:28:28Z,2025-01-29
XaqOejIaFgM,"I’ve owned iPhones for the last 8yrs, I’m currently on day 2 with my S24 Ultra and I absolutely love it. It’s fantastic.",2024-01-28T03:51:35Z,2024-01-28
XaqOejIaFgM,"I've had the S22 Ultra since a few months after it came out, and it's still going strong, but I'm actually compelled to get the 24. One of my favorite things about my S22 Ultra is the zoom on it. I actually just use the view finder like binoculars all the time because the zoom is so insane and stable.
I really thought I could hold off on an upgrade for longer than this, but the S24 Ultra is just so much better, and the flat screen just makes it perfect",2024-02-20T07:13:39Z,2024-02-20
XaqOejIaFgM,The software support and 1TB are my main reasons to get this phone for under $600 with my trade-in.,2024-01-26T21:56:40Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,Loving the custom keyboards in the BRoll shots,2024-01-26T23:12:07Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,I definitely want a video about those intricacies in colabs between smartphone companies.,2024-01-27T10:06:26Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,Got the base S24 two days ago (I had a S20FE before) and am having fun with all the features. The AI autocorrection is especially helpful to me as a non-native English speaker (the feature is also used for this text). And those seven years of updates are tempting.,2024-01-26T22:40:05Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,Just got a S24 Ultra...,2025-04-06T05:30:18Z,2025-04-06
XaqOejIaFgM,"Just waiting on mine to arrive at Feb 7. I knew this phone was going to be a monster. The new 5x, the 4k120, the 8k on the 5x, the 2600 peak brightness and anti reflective screen makes it easier to shoot outdoors. And also not to mention the shutter lag finally it's gone!! Can't wait!!",2024-01-27T04:24:40Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"I got mine on Friday and was worried I'd have buyers remorse, but so far I'm so impressed with it. It's very snappy and honestly fun to use.",2024-01-28T18:18:14Z,2024-01-28
XaqOejIaFgM,"Very interesting to see that Google and Samsung are collaborating like crazy to build up an unified Android empire to compete with Apple. At this point we might as well call them the Android S24 Ultra, and Android 8 Pro 😂",2024-01-27T01:45:21Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"I just got this phone, the camera quality alone its just crazy",2024-10-05T15:00:57Z,2024-10-05
XaqOejIaFgM,"Marques, I would love to see you do a separate video on Samsung and google's need for each other. I've always thought this and think it would be great for you to dive into the subject.",2024-02-23T16:56:10Z,2024-02-23
XaqOejIaFgM,It’s rare to see you this pleased doing a review.,2024-01-31T02:44:13Z,2024-01-31
XaqOejIaFgM,"I dont know about the U.S. 
But here in the UK they're offering all of the following on each purchase:
£100 discount, free upgrade to 512GB, 1yr disney+, 3 months accidental cover, £30 store credit.",2024-01-29T18:58:35Z,2024-01-29
XaqOejIaFgM,I'm here to see all that the s25 Ultra can do that was not covered.,2025-01-26T18:04:17Z,2025-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,"It's not often I get to use the same device Marques drops a review on. Got my S24U couple of days back and the other alternative I considered was Pixel 8 pro. I loved the fact that Google and Samsung joined hands on this, especially at the AI on edge computing paradigm we are embarking on now. Phone is incredible, love that the AI features are not in your face but just there. Integrated as if they were always there. Great video as usual and ya, that video on Google+Samsung against the world is worth exploring. And I think this collaboration could go beyond phones as well, like Google TV on Samsung TVs.",2024-01-27T05:12:00Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"My S24 ultra arrived this week, the AI generative fill on photos is insane! I keep trying photos and removing people/objects and it blows my mind each time, even difficult photos where I don't expect it to work, and it does it. Super impressive.",2024-01-27T00:28:49Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,The synergy between Google and Samsung is welcome and will make things better for every android consumer. The one thing I would like to see is feature drops on Samsungs like Google does with the Pixels and give more attention to older models. The S23 getting these AI features is a step in the right direction. Another thing everyone seems to overlook about Pixels is that their purpose is also to push other manufacturers to make their OS experience better and simpler for their users. I think this is evident with Samsung's recent One UI updates.,2024-01-27T07:36:35Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,I made the switch been on apple for years I got the s24 ultra over the 25 ultra I don't regret it 😊,2025-05-21T10:10:14Z,2025-05-21
XaqOejIaFgM,"I ordered the S24+ and am very excited for it. Hobestly price aside, the only things I like more about the Ultra is the 5x telephoto, and the much better Gorilla Glass (anti reflective, and very scratch resistant). Otherwise I'm very excited for the S24+, and prefer the slightly smaller size with rounded corners.",2024-01-26T21:51:45Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,Finally back to flat displays. I never liked the curved screens that had inconsistent viewing experiences near the edge. Also THANK YOU SAMSUNG for adding a good anti reflective coating. Most underrated feature.,2024-01-26T21:51:21Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,"I got it immediately; after waiting years from the note not being available, to this ""ultra"" being a significantly more expensive upgrade and skipping ANOTHER year, finally pulled the trigger and I effing love it. Black, but all the colors are sweet.",2024-02-15T00:35:31Z,2024-02-15
XaqOejIaFgM,"I bought an S9 when it was released. Im writting on that same phone today, have zero problems whatsoever but being an IT maniac, i know this phone will eventually die out.

XaqOejIaFgM,I'm with Samsung since the note 4 .  Maybe iPhone users don't notice it but there s something on iPhones that no other phone can duplicate . The software response to the touch  .

K-JGaqfIOmI,"To me, if I'm going to pay extra for a phone upgrade, there has to be significant improvement in the camera.  I had both the S24 Ultra and was to trade in my S22 Ultra.

K-JGaqfIOmI,"I don't care who has the best camera or is the fastest phone in benchmarks. Every flagship smartphone takes super pictures and video's and is blazing fast. 97% of all smartphone users don't even see the differences.
I'm a SMARTPHONE user so I want the best screen (dpi/brightness/anti-glare), best battery, best/most usablility and productivity options, best gaming- and multi-media experience, best personalization options and best innovation. 
I want DEX, KNOX, S-PEN, call recording, multi-tasking, multi-window, fingerprint scanner, best screen, widgets, themes, integration with windows, the biggest eco-system (Samsung SmartThings), fast charging, fast wireless charging, SEVEN YEARS OF UPDATES and I want AI.
On all these aspects the S24 Ultra is destroying the iphone 15 PM big time.  So why keep people buying these antiquated, restricted and very very limited iphones?",2024-02-16T21:23:41Z,2024-02-16

K-JGaqfIOmI,"Sorry, but may it be that you confused the namings left / right on the photo comparison? Because everything you said regarding where the s24 was better, felt like  you were talking about the right part of the picture, because it is more defined, more detail, more texture, better dyncamic range... check out the 5x vs 3x at 07:21 for example. Or the night-scene at 06:24. the right part (""s23"") looks better to my eyes, noticeably! It would also be helpful, if you sometimes mark something in those shots with a pen, so watcher can see a hint which example / detail you mean in the picture. At 6:21 -> check out the wall wwhere the 3 little trees are in front. The Right picutre is way more defined / detailed / lit up! Or look at the bricks  texture at the building... obvious! Best regards :)",2025-05-05T22:28:01Z,2025-05-05
K-JGaqfIOmI,I understand their an update fix for the Vivid setting to obviously be more VIVID .Remember the screen has the Anti Glare effect so the screen is appears darker. That would be effected by a screen protector. The Anti Glare feature appears to be forgotten by Samsung wich it ironically is not promoted???🤔Note to future proof your phone  if possible get the 512gb  or 1Terebyte Version. This will increase the resale value. Plus add a motivation for buying. I am using the S22 Ultra 512 version. At the time the seller upgraded to the S23 Ultra and was moving to each new iteration as part of his job. So I got the S22 Ultra a year ago on Ebay for $430 What a surprise. Good Timing 😎 Good Video 😎,2024-02-18T05:55:25Z,2024-02-18
K-JGaqfIOmI,"I've had the phone for 5 days, A52S 5g- switched, feels like a hyper jump. Battery life, camera zoom, speed, looks and s-pen are amazing. I thought about switching to s25 ultra but I don't like the rounded look of it.",2025-06-15T07:44:44Z,2025-06-15
K-JGaqfIOmI,"But I still haven't seen anyone asking Samsung, why these super powerful Ultra phones, which can record 4k 120, 8K, translate phono calls in real time etc., still aren't able to, in Pro Video to adjust contrast, saturation, shadows etc. in anything higher that FHD resolution!!
I really don't get it, people shooting ""Pro"" often want to have a more flat picture, with less contrast and less saturation, but Pro people don't use 4k ?

﻿
﻿I have noticed that the frame around the 50MP periscope telephoto camera on my phone is slightly tilted, approximately 5-7 degrees off from the vertical or relative to the phone's vertical edge. This seems like it could be an assembly issue during production.
﻿
﻿Could other users with a 50MP periscope telephoto lens check their cameras for any similar tilt in the frame relative to the vertical or phone edge? I’d appreciate any feedback on this.

K-JGaqfIOmI,"I love Android, especially Samsung. I've been considering getting a new phone, but there's a complete deal breaker for me: I've never been able to get voice commands to work using the Gboard keyboard. Since I dislike the other keyboards available on Android, I don't really have a solution.

I've always stuck with iPhone because of this issue. The voice command on iPhone may not be the best—neither as fast nor as effective as on Android—but at least it works.

If anyone has a solution that works, I'd be ready to switch back to Android, because the Galaxy S24 Ultra is really tempting me.

The only Android phone where I find that voice commands work right out of the box is on Google's Pixels. The problem is that I don't necessarily want a Pixel; I generally prefer Samsung, especially their high-end models.

It not only allows me to write much faster to many different people, but I am also disabled, so it's much less exhausting for me to speak than to type long texts by hand",2024-05-10T18:17:06Z,2024-05-10

The performance gap may have got closer over the years but my god the stuttering and random lag spikes you get when navigating the phone is ridiculous and its been on every samsung device that I had with this chipset im surprised no one is complaining about this.

SFA62-4Sncw,"This comment is important.  DO NOT BUY ANY SAMSUNG DEVICE. Samsung updates will randomly give your device a green line. Do not listen to them saying it's damage, because I had multiple devices develop the line simultaneously,  no damage, some in box, and these are multiple generations of devices. The only common factor, an update. Samsung refuses to fix the issue, even denying they've had reports if thus, although there are hundreds of thousands facing this issue, if not more. There are reports on their own help forum, but they deny. You will be asked to return it to a Samsung repair center, if you live in a country that has these, and you will be charged a fee if your device is older than 1 year. This fee does not cover repairs. They will want to replace the screen, but the issue will eventually return because it's a software defect. I trust you know a new screen is almost the cost of the device. Note, even if you are in warranty,  you're not covered. Fingernail scratches are considered user damage, but tempered screen protectors are also considered damage because they use adhesive.  I have never seen that adhesive  damage a screen. Essentially,  they're damaging your device with an update you gave no choice in installing,  then will charge you to repair it. It is a cash grab that should face a class action  lawsuit.  Note that this is not based solely on my experience,rather, it is the common experience of those who encounter this problem and reach out to Samsung for help.",2025-02-16T00:46:15Z,2025-02-16

In Performance, both are almost the same but slight edge towards S24U.

In Design, Google Pixel looks good compared to S24 Ultra but people have different opinions on this. 

In Camera, both are almost equal. While Pixel photos have shadows and keep it RAW and S24 is more bright and colorful. While S24U is 100X zoom and Pixel is 30X zoom.
Rear Cam: Pixel has Triple Cam with 50MP + 48MP + 48 MP while S24U with 200MP Quad Cam.
Front Cam: Pixel has 42MP and S24U has 12MP. 

In Display, I will give it for Pixel bcz of OLED Display which is the best display in the market compared to S24U Amoled.

ZCRPfo-md90,You have to get a special screen protector to take advantage of the new type of glass that prevents reflective glare. If you use an ordinary protector you will lose the benefit of the new glare resistant glass. The special protector costs about $30.,2024-10-04T15:35:02Z,2024-10-04

elYbZ0z2Qr0,"The S Pen is seriously one of the most underrated tools. I use it for everything -taking notes, snapping group photos, signing documents, and even for those casual flex moments. One of the coolest features is how it effortlessly converts my less-than-perfect handwriting into clean, typed text. I remember back when I used take class notes with the S Pen-it was so efficient and easy to use. It's amazing how they packed so much functionality into such a small, sleek pen!",2024-10-02T04:41:39Z,2024-10-02

elYbZ0z2Qr0,The most important and useful feature of s pen that nobody talks about is that you can copy literally every text on your screen at any time. Places where you cant do that on other phones. Take instagram as example. I dont know any other phone that can copy text from instagram bios or post descriptions. I have been a lover of note series. Now it is the s series.,2024-12-19T12:53:04Z,2024-12-19

elYbZ0z2Qr0,"I've owned several notes, and now the S24 Ultra as well. I've used the S-Pen for many things, signing documents, sketching up remodel ideas, etc, but never to trigger the camera. For that, I use what I believe is the most underrated Samsung feature, voice activated camera.",2024-12-28T00:13:22Z,2024-12-28
elYbZ0z2Qr0,It can also zoom in and zoom out using the pen,2024-09-12T14:42:59Z,2024-09-12

elYbZ0z2Qr0,My manager asked me all the time to print papers and then write info inside them manually ... i used the s pen to just write everything inside the pdf and then send it back without even printing .. It's the best feature ever,2024-09-22T16:06:45Z,2024-09-22
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"To be honest, I can't afford a thousand dollar bag no matter how beautiful it is. I can say with certainty that every   kislux   bag I've owned has been solid.

elYbZ0z2Qr0,"For me Samsung are great I like their products but my issue with this new phones ultra is that the S Pen makes them big while S before had a better thinness.

I cannot believe that they provided a serious review without noticing the washed-out colors compared to last year's model.  I lost trust in virtually all of the top reviewers over it.  How can they not notice this? I could tell the moment I walked into the store and saw the phone that the colors were worse.,2024-02-06T07:56:48Z,2024-02-06

umJbhJRe67I,"I've owned mine for what feels like  6 months. This is not a working mans phone. There's not much improvement over the note 10 which isn't surprising since that phone was excellent. 
 The S24 ultra is for people who live for their phone. It's extremely fiddly and the AI is extremely suspicious. EG i looked up the calender for a date Tuesday the 26th...gee the twenty six is actually Monday gd it. The audio alert volume was lowered yesterday...today it back. Also it needs q specific case because how it's held is extremely important and it needs to still charge wirelessly. All the while it still has a crappy spell ck and it l9ves commas more than anything...to a fault. Also it's the most inconsistent phone I've ever owned. Some times the touch screen doesn't snap to it while other times I'm a half inch from the screen and it responds. Even the simple thing are not yet available such as a choice of 3 rows of word suggestions instead of numbers and emojis  rows.
 I can't stress enough how fiddly it is. It's me vs how i need my phone to behave challenge. 
 Not more than a decade ago sony started a campaign that changes the wording of instructions that made them vague. The s24ultra is similar but instead of vague it different aka there's a better way to state it. Also it has its share of wokeness. 
 Finally, I was looking at photos on a friends phone that wasn't a Samsung and they looked noticeably more clear and vibrant. Imho. Also why can't it use gps when there isn't any towers nearby? Why does the map get covered with unwanted crap when using Google maps and that stupid spin feature has never gone away since day one. I understand that it on Google but still...and how about streaming music in the car with ""downloaded "" music only for it to drop dead the moment there isn't a signal. Why isn't there a back button? They're  fkn delete buttons? There're different sorts of delete buttons!

z598clQ71JY,"For anyone confused: ""stand-by battery"" is not a second battery. It means how much power the one battery uses when the phone is not actively being used.",2024-11-30T19:14:42Z,2024-11-30
z598clQ71JY,"After trying out the Iphone 15 pro max for a week, I switched to the s24 ultra & honestly it's the best phone. Not 100% perfect but simply the best 👌",2024-08-03T20:11:55Z,2024-08-03
z598clQ71JY,"At 58, I went from the cheapest phones from Tracphone for a 2 week road trip for emergencies, to my last was Samsung A53 5G, to the one I got Wednesday, the unlocked Samsung S24 Ultra.  I went from the 19th century to the 23rd with this jump in tech.  Since I got I have been playing with it to remove all the crap and turn off all the background stuff and make sure it is set right.  THANKS for the tips.   At 68, I am amazed at the capabilities of a hand held device.  I grew up with the original Star Trek and the Doctors hand held device is here!     I'm happy I can still be amazed at the new tech.",2025-01-25T19:35:50Z,2025-01-25

z598clQ71JY,"Nice. I'll likely move back to Samsung in 2025 for the S25 Ultra. 

My iPhone 15 Pro battery isn't kicking it for me. I also miss the Samsung ecosystem; especially the S-Pen, which I use a lot.",2024-07-29T16:23:21Z,2024-07-29
z598clQ71JY,"Fyi the goodlock update was pushed out about a month ago, at least for my unlocked u.s. version. One other thing as to the s pen, NOBODY ever mentions its website usage. It's why i find the s pen so useful. For small hyperlinks, forms, and maps. Furthermore i need extremely precise map coordinates for search & rescue as well as noaa maps, and the s pen does what a finger cannot.

z598clQ71JY,"Something everyone misses about screen saturation on the S24s is that by default the saturation slider is set to the lowest. Go into settings>display>adaptive colour tone and turn it off. Then go into screen mode, select ""vivid"" then the ""advanced settings"" button. You will get a 3 step slider. By default it is set to the lowest. I have mine in the middle. But if you like the old samsung overly saturated look, you can get it by sliding it to the max. The screen is amazing either way. And then you CAN turn adaptive colour tone back on.",2024-09-24T04:17:01Z,2024-09-24

z598clQ71JY,I got used to the S Pen on my small Note20 so I bought the S24Ultra to continue to enjoy the advantages. The S Pen is much more precise in choosing things on the screen (like the tiny 'X's to close annoying overlay ads). I also suspect the oleophobic coating on the screen to last longer 🤞,2024-07-29T01:50:51Z,2024-07-29

z598clQ71JY,"Coming from a pre-ordered Note 20 Ultra, this thing has been fantastic! Definitely a fan of the decision to drop the curved edges. The battery life has been amazing, and the cameras are a nice improvement for me, despite the sometimes odd post processing. Ready to have this thing for the next 7 years",2024-07-28T23:10:15Z,2024-07-28
z598clQ71JY,"Every phone have pros and cons…no one is perfect… but in the S24U i see an good all rounder. Yes, the price is still pretty big, but probably before Black Friday or on BF will be at an more resonable price i hope. I want to switch from an iPhone 13(not pro, the simple one) to S24U and i’m convinced that the camera is not that spectaular how many many youtubers said…but you get the job done with it…at least is a flagship phone…
Good job with the video!",2024-07-31T00:20:50Z,2024-07-31
z598clQ71JY,"I keep going back to my S24U opposed to my P8. After using standard Galaxy or the ""Plus"" verisons from S8-S10 era's, I figured I drop my S21 for the premium S24U. This thing is so good when it comes to shooting concert shots, fast / responsive interface, battery, cooling, customization, display. I will try out my P8 every other month or in special use cases when not wanting to lug around a larger phone. I find the software fun with the haptics and animations on the P8, but the S24U always feels like home. 

I hope Samsung one day can bring the flagship Ultra into a smaller, rounded corner variation like Google is doing with the P9 Pro. I'm VERY interested.",2024-07-29T14:38:03Z,2024-07-29

z598clQ71JY,"The problem with the S24U’s camera this year is that the yellow haunting color is too heavy on the 5x camera, many users from all over the country complain, but Samsung still ignores that problem and after many updates this situation remains unchanged. Especially the terrible yellow haunting situation occurs when filming videos at the 5x camera. You can fix Whit Balance by pro mode but in this mode you cannot be switched between cameras. It's so stupid. They even removed the feature of recording portrait videos 3x optical in the previously existing on the S23U.",2024-07-28T02:07:51Z,2024-07-28
z598clQ71JY,"I don't think your camera review is fair, because u keep comparing the phone to a device that is dedicated to take pics in high quality, and still the phones camera stands out to the Fujifilm camera",2024-09-05T02:04:32Z,2024-09-05

z598clQ71JY,"I agree very much with this review about it being worth it or not. I'd like to get the S24+ instead, but it comes with Exynos in my region (Brazil). Only the S24U comes with Snapdragon 8 Gen3 here.

The alternative would be the much more well priced S23+, but August 2nd is my b-day and I wanted to splurge on a top tier smartphone to swap my Galaxy A51 for and keep it for years.",2024-07-28T01:47:46Z,2024-07-28

z598clQ71JY,"If u want absolute best camera s24 ultra isnt for u better of with dslr, if u want best battery s24 u again isnt the choice, go for one of those bulky bricks of a phone with 6-10k mah batteries, if u want fastest charging then its better to go with budget androids that have 100-240 watt charging, if u want smoothest ui u can stick with stock android like that on pixel or ios but but if u want the best versatile phone there is the phone with everything then s24 ultra might be it Best ever display, one of the best cameras, one of the best battery timing, one of the best ui if not the best, best looking too in my opinion and waterproofing then s24 ultra is the only chocie",2024-07-27T17:59:25Z,2024-07-27

z598clQ71JY,Just got the s24 ultra 2 days ago. Best phone I've ever had. Love it.,2024-08-26T15:26:32Z,2024-08-26
z598clQ71JY,"I upgraded from an S22 Ultra to an S24 Ultra 2 days ago, and honestly, the experience is almost identical. The main reasons I upgraded are that my old phone had some scratches on the front screen and bezel, and I also wanted 7 years of software support. The S22 Ultra is only good for 3 Android version updates, and next year would be its last one. It will receive security patches for a while, but after Android 15, there will be no more official versions for it.

I'm hoping to keep this one for a long time. Prior to the S21 Ultra 5G (Exynos) and S22 Ultra (Snapdragon), I had my S7 for over 5 years. Now that everything just feels like an incremental upgrade, I think that I will stay put.",2024-12-19T02:38:45Z,2024-12-19
z598clQ71JY,"I have purchased Samsung phones exclusively since cell phones came on the scene. My current phone is the Z Fold 4; however, that phone became virtually unusable when it suffered from what I understand is a not so uncommon problem: when I fold and close the phone (from its very impressive full screen) it shuts off. I mean, it powers down completely and the only way to access the phone is to turn it on and go through the power-on protocol. This means, I now must use my phone as a tablet, unless I am willing to go through the 2-3 minute power-on process each time I close the phone. I am passed warranty and repairs here in Mexico are somewhat problematic AND, how can you not have your phone for the days required for it to be repaired, a cost, I have been told, also appears to be steep... So, I have decided to switch from the foldable phones (which are beautiful) and I've ordered the S24 Ultra. I do hope the transition to a small screen won't be too much of a disappointment. Then again--to not have your phone work is a pretty serious disappointment in itself.    Thank you for the fair assessment of the S24 Ultra. By the way (oh, can yammer so) I have extensive high-quality photography gear. That said, the convenience of have my always-available phone/camera has allowed me to take innumerable high-quality photographs I would not have had were it not for my phone. The photos I have taken with my Samsung phones, given the nature of the equipment, have been and continue to be superb. I do run them through Snapseed software, and, again, given the nature of the equipment, I couldn't be happier. ... Thanks for allowing me space to ramble.",2024-09-07T21:12:20Z,2024-09-07
z598clQ71JY,"I switched from iPhone 15 pro back to android samsung s24 ultra  , and my experience so far is amazing,  I love screen , the 5x zoom replacing the 10x was a conscious decision,  I find the phone gave me a better experience and value over the iPhone",2024-11-02T20:12:59Z,2024-11-02

But if you're going to be taking photos at important events such as weddings and things like that, especially if you were doing it as a favour for someone,  you would NOT be using a smartphone.  That's just fact.  You would use a dedicated camera for that.  Other than that though, I am looking to upgrade my s20+ so I think this would be awesome.",2024-07-28T02:22:38Z,2024-07-28

z598clQ71JY,i will not buy a dedicated camera.  the s24 ultra is good enough and more.,2024-11-08T17:09:18Z,2024-11-08
z598clQ71JY,So I found the best help for the over processing of images is to go into the gallery settings and turn super hdr off.,2024-07-28T02:00:40Z,2024-07-28
z598clQ71JY,Still the best designed phone on the market in my opinion despite the sharp corners. The body screen is perfect for watching content and interacting with the interface. Will hold on to this for years to come.,2025-03-18T21:03:57Z,2025-03-18
z598clQ71JY,When he started talking about the camera stuff I had no idea what he was talking about.It takes good pics that’s all that matters,2024-11-03T05:07:48Z,2024-11-03

z598clQ71JY,Well said. If I really want a proper camera I would default to a handheld camera. Nowadays even mid range phones are producing great photos and videos.,2024-09-02T11:39:40Z,2024-09-02

z598clQ71JY,"One thing I've noticed in mine, is that the phone heats up when using camera stuff. Which I assume is because of AI integration working simultaneously, but I dunno exactly why",2024-08-16T09:11:27Z,2024-08-16
z598clQ71JY,"I do understand why people want a good camera, but let's be honest: Apart from photographers and ""Pixel Counters"" a regular person can't tell the difference between a Samsung XXX XXX and a Nokia Lumia 1020 from 2013. Even on a PC Screen. Smartphone Cameras (in Daylight) are good enough for a LONG TIME now.
If you really want to take photos and print them on everything thats a little bit larger, you need a DLSR anyway, since the quality difference is enormous because of the lens.",2024-09-04T05:22:32Z,2024-09-04

z598clQ71JY,I'm switching to S24 Ultra after 3.5 years with Xiaomi Mi11. And as a person who works with smartphones on daily basis I know it's gonna be a big upgrade. Partly because of raw power since I plan to use PlayStation 2 emulator to be able to basically relive my childhood on the go. And where Mi11 struggles with some games I feel like S24 Ultra will run all of them smoothly,2024-12-30T10:51:03Z,2024-12-30

z598clQ71JY,"With this camera software (it seems even worse then S23U which was already terrible), S24U can't even be considered good phone, let alone great or the best. Paying over 1000 bucks for flagship in 2024. and then ending up with blurry pictures of anything with even slight movement (and many other camera problems)... should not be acceptable.",2024-07-30T13:04:48Z,2024-07-30

ePdbj2bZ-Ro,"I've always had flagship phones of Samsung, since the S5, S7 Edge, Note 9, and s24 ultra . But I had recently switched from s24 Ultra to s24+ and I couldn't be more happier 😃!Yes, there are many features on the s24 ultra such as the anti-reflective glass S pen 200mb camera and a couple smart features. But the problem I had was that the edges of the ultra kept digging into my hands and it was unbearably heavy. When I switched to the s24+ 0:42 , it was like a breath of fresh air because it felt so good in the hand and it was so lightweight and the edges of the phone made it non-slip and in my opinion this is the best phone I've ever had. That being said, if I can change one thing that would make it the best phone of all time right now would be to have it in the previous previous model's colour of s23+ (Phantom Black). 💯🖤",2024-06-12T17:13:49Z,2024-06-12

OwczHVhUav8,Key differences when spotting phone vs camera is the white balance you can notice phones make subjects brighter for ready viewing while cameras focus on getting all the environment details and as close to the human eye for more editing accessibilities later on,2025-01-19T15:57:39Z,2025-01-19

B--good appearance ❤
😊😊",2024-03-04T08:24:33Z,2024-03-04
OwczHVhUav8,"I would say 99% sure:

A: Sony
B: Samsung

The 3rd photo is what made me decide. In general the photos look pretty similar and hard to differenciate, but in that 3rd one spotted something that happens with Samsung's portraits, and is that obviously, they dont have the physical capacity to make that depth of field naturally, so they hape to fake it, and it does a great job in general, but some times you can see some artifacts it makes like putting one random leaf in focus, some imperfections in the edges, and not realizing that the subject has parts where you can see the background, like your glasses, and when that happens it doesnt blur that part.

At this point, a professional camera is better in that, for professional use, when you want to edit the photo not just a bit. With a phone you can can get pretty much close, but doesnt let you thaaat much space for correction as it does with a real camera, it loses so much detail when you try to brighten dark parts or darken bright parts.",2025-01-22T05:25:20Z,2025-01-22

Simple Calculation:
 * 68% charged in 7 minutes.

 * To charge 100%, it takes 100% x 0.103 minutes ≈ 10.3 minutes.",2025-01-01T13:56:47Z,2025-01-01

That's why I say if and when they pay wall the AI.... Let them do it where if we don't want them... They make a download to take them OFF THE PHONE. Like an app suite that we have to pay for...",2024-11-24T21:20:55Z,2024-11-24

IajedKzp9bM,I have both the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and may view is as follows:  face ID is poor on the Ultra and the finger print scanner could be better.

lSloa0O-VjM,"I have never been a fan of any kind of update policy and only installed it because it was available for my 24 ultra. In conclusion, I personally have to say that I could have done without it, because there isn't a single function that offers any real added value and most things are, as always, just optical retouching. But I'm not disappointed either as I didn't really expect anything else.... Thanks for the video though",2025-05-09T16:22:51Z,2025-05-09

nyxcO2vdcCg,Funny how the S25 is back to scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7... This was just too good for them,2025-02-01T21:50:38Z,2025-02-01
nyxcO2vdcCg,Just switched (like an hour ago) to an s24 ultra from exclusively having an iPhone. Something just felt different about Samsung this year and I had to see for myself. I am way too pleased with the tiny pen that lives inside my phone now,2024-01-30T20:20:07Z,2024-01-30
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I just got my s24 ultra yesterday. And the screen clarity on this thing is absolutely insane. I have had a note series phone since the two and the 10 plus I had for 4 years and actually love that phone. I only upgraded to the fold4 last year after they killed off the note series and I wanted to get the newest 5G capabilities and not just the ultra wide 5G that the Note 10 plus 5G came with. But I found myself using the front small screen more often than taking the time to open up the phone to use it and really only used it to watch movies or shows. And since the ultra line took back where the note left that big gaping hole in the Samsung lineup I decided to jump back and get the 24 ultra. Where with trading in my fold4, getting a pre-order discount, and another $150 off coupon on top of it, and the 512 GB matching for the same price as the 256, I got mine delivered for just a hair over $700. It also came with case and screen protector and I got the Samsung buds pro 2 for free with it as well. So all in all not a bad deal for all that for that price.",2024-01-30T18:25:33Z,2024-01-30
nyxcO2vdcCg,"For the S24 Ultra, as nice and durable the tiranium frame is, the anti reflective screen is the upgrade that stood out for me, as it won’t glare like other phone screens especially when using it under the direct sun.

I got to hold the S25 ultra at the store today and just, eugh, this will unfortunately be a deal breaker for me. It's not just light it's drastically lighter than any larger smartphone, giving it an unappealing hollowness to it. Maybe some people will like it, but 218 grams for a 6.9 in phone is insane. That's lighter than the iPhone 16 Plus which is already considered to be very light! This whole cheap feeling in the hand just makes me think about are all the hardware they've removed this year with the S-Pen.

xr8CpY3tM8U,"Be cool if you were to show us your task  launcher and prove that you don’t have the apps already loaded on the s24u vs iPhone 15PM launching from a cold start - I’ve got both phones and will do the same test this evening. Film it too - as well, I can show you identical apps (X-Plane & Aerofly FS World), very taxing amps with user control over graphic performance - where the s24 ultra can’t maintain 30fps (dropping as low as 12-14fps in populated areas and/or cockpit controls) - while the iPhone, same settings, doesn’t drop below 57-58fps, regardless of the terrain or the drawing of instrumentation and real time mapping on a glass cockpit. Even has a difficult time with steam gauge SuperCubs and 15/172s! 

I love both for different reasons, and I can show you the fact the S24 Ultra will NOT allow the use of Google Drive and/or Photos as a default repository for media or backing up your phone. The ONLY option is OneDrive! I’ve owned every iPhone since 2007, and along with them, I purchased an Android phone - initially, Notes 1, 2, 4, & 5 - I switched to Pixels, back to Sammy, and took a couple year break, until the S21/iPhone 11. This, even though the 11’s had the power and efficiency in the chip, the 21 was a better choice in my opinion. That opinion changed with 12 - 15 (I have 15PM and 24u, no 16/25) and the ridiculous redundancy of EVERY mandatory smartphone app; calendars, phones, messaging, notes, wallets, stores, calculators, voice recorders, contacts, clocks, ‘internet’, reminders, find my apps, and I’ve likely forgotten a dozen - but the ones I named ALL have the option to use the Samsung or Google version of the keyboard (one I forgot) as the default keyboard 
Unfortunately, and as ubiquitous as Google Drive/Photos (2 apps Mt View hasn’t abandoned) have been the last decade, as well as they’ve worked cross platform - whether WIndows or macOS, iOS, Android or iPadOS, Drive and Photos are arguably as good or better file managers than others’ native apps. Like Sammy’s Gallery! Who’s EVER used it other than Samsung SXX users? Or Galaxy tabs or laptops? Those are the ONLY three things capable of accessing your Samsung Gallery
EVERY other Android phone or tablet - including Samsung, has allowed Google Photos as your repository for stills and motion, Drive for audio and docs spreadsheets etc. No longer.

NOW if you want your pictures backed up you HAVE to have a subscription for MS365, which includes OneDrive, the ONLY option for photo backup (& video and everything else on your phone) able to be used other than a local SSD, same that you can do on iPhone - however, I can choose Chrome as my default browser on iPhone - Google Maps as my default mapping app, or G-Mail, Drive, Photos, everything is an option on Apple’s products.

The fact Samsung has 
A) dropped support for Photos and
B) done the same with Drive is over the top, and IMO, a purchase killer. Period

As a subscriber already of MS365 pre-s24u purchase, I’d have returned it, as you’re looking at an extra $120 a year to store your photos in the cloud, instead of the tiers of Google storage sizes.
This is my biggest complaint about the Samsung phones but followed closely by a few dozen redundant apps that Samsung copies Google’s and other’s to use open code software as a foundation for ONE UI, the crappiest OS on mobile in existence. Even though G-Board eats storage, the Samsung keyboard’s a joke.

I will say, the ONLY two things I’ve found preferable on the s24U vs the iPhone are the display (but ‘just’ as both are stellar) and the lack of almost ANY software I use 90% of the time on iOS and iPadOS - from incredible cameras for both stills and video, Timelapse and celestial - Play Store options are a joke in comparison… and audio production; from Digital Audio Workstations AKA DAWs to synths, percussion, wave editing and simple recording apps with multitrack abilities that are essential for prosecution. 
Why a positive? I don’t  have to buy them again!
Display, a slight edge, otherwise, I guess - and I’ve tried, I’m not a phone customizer guy. The themes and goofy fonts, the single colors or gradients, and the need to feel unique or different doesn’t appeal to me at all, and wile the ultrasonic finger print reader is amazing, it also sucks trying to land it correctly first try… where is the iPhone or iPad w/Face ID work instantly, battery life are near parity, my 15PM might have a slight edge, especially if gaming. And Microsoft and Adobe have MUCH better performance and capability, as well as apps - period - on iOS. While Docs and Sheets work okay, they don’t compare to the MS Suite, not even Apple’s Office suite - and messaging? What a S&%T Show! 
iMessage is so far ahead of either Goog or Sam’s messaging - and anyone older than 30’s not ‘Snapping’ - and unless you’re a fan of illegal communication, Signal and the rest don’t hold a candle to iMessage’s continuity with all Apple products one has; Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, Car Play, Home Pods, Air Pods, vertical and horizontal integration is definitely a massive plus, even though Samsung’s doing their best to jump in the sack with Windows, using connect to Windows, OneDrive as only option to backup - they’d be better off developing, from scratch, without the 30 years of x86 cruft built on cruft so you can still run that ‘legacy’ software that’s not been updated since last millennium - Samsung could easily take a couple years to write a decent third OS, without the Android Open Source code or the foundation of Windows 11’s nightmares… instead building better continuity between ALL devices - opening their market up significantly (and giving their customers back a dozen gigs of memory while eliminating the Google apps you can’t use!)",2025-04-03T01:20:34Z,2025-04-03

4. When i want to take full control of screenshot and screenshot editing with precise screen writing.

2. Signing (or editing) PDFs and sending them back in record timing

1. Editing watermarks out of my kids school pictures

I dont use it all the time but i absolutely dont want to be without it. Sort of like my jumper cables. I cant remember the last time my car died. But I've jumped peoples car like twice this year.

Then all a sudden the S24 was on sale down from $1200aud to $877 which is literally half the price of the plus. So I got it. Love it just a little small after years of my old S10 plus.

RcFKsAUzcXM,"the reason i bought note 9 second hand some times ago is because its the most affordable stylus phone that i could buy at the time that still works ok. truly an on site work phone. take photos, draw arrows, circles, jot notes directly, and sent it to other division in real time, its precise so you can write smaller and longer sentences without zooming and its readable. very nice. should be on cheaper mid range phone with big battery rather than as a complementary stuff on the top of your product line. way better than carrying rugged big tablet with poor battery stylus for on site job. you tend to baby those expensive phone so it lasts long but it defeats the puropse of having stylus on a phone in the first place. its for work.",2025-04-16T15:05:37Z,2025-04-16

My Note 20 5G Ultra had antenna issues, a cracked screen (first time ever) and thereforee holds no data connection. Went to a repair shop and $300 for antenna, screen replacements. Now my battery is swelling. 
I have a personal situation with one of my children that requires a need for constant ability to reach me. Needed to borrow $650, which i could have paid back, but no one would help me. Not even my daughter's father who lives with his parents and pays for nothing. 
Not looking for hand outs, nothing like that.

If you are an avid S-Pen user and don't mind the bulk, go for the Ultra. But if you are like me and prefer a smaller, lighter device after lugging around a behemoth of a phone for years, go for the base S24. You won't miss much.",2024-11-30T06:38:30Z,2024-11-30
RcFKsAUzcXM,the ultra is like a mini tablet that can do everything its definatly worth having. i know the price is crazy but you can find amazing deals online,2024-09-24T20:51:28Z,2024-09-24

RcFKsAUzcXM,"ngl the s pen is actually pretty great to me, i use it all the time to take pictures while my phone is set up some where, i love my s22 ultra bc when me and my girl friend or family members have special moments i can use my phone and the pen to get a really nice wide shot of everyone to preserve memories, other than that the s pen isnt very useful and if ur gonna get the s24 ultra jus for the pen ur better off getting a 23 or 24 n buying a s pen seperate or getting a older ultra phone like the note 20 ultra or s22 ultra",2024-10-11T11:25:26Z,2024-10-11

Makes the phone feel better",2024-09-25T17:42:55Z,2024-09-25
RcFKsAUzcXM,"I like the anti-glare on the Ultra, and in the UK it was the only one with Snapdragon. If the 24+ had the anti-glare screen and the same CPU I would have got that instead.",2024-12-22T10:00:53Z,2024-12-22
RcFKsAUzcXM,"4k60 recording and seamlessly switch between the physical lenses?! yeah - S24 iltra for the win! And I LOVE the S-pen ever since the Galaxy Note II - which still lays around in my household.

S24 Ultra on black friday sale for 899 sounds good to me - although I would love to see it go down to 699 before I buy it. Currently still using my Samsung note 10",2024-11-28T16:06:56Z,2024-11-28

Aún así no creo que valga tanto la pena cambiar un s23 por el s24",2024-02-22T00:15:11Z,2024-02-22

LKRmYI9bYoI,"Lo del calentamiento es completamente real es increíble que estás jugando a 60 fps ejemplo un juego de autos y por algo así te baja muchos fps en comparación a el OnePlus 11 que lo más bajo que te da son 54.

LKRmYI9bYoI,"No creo las especulaciones sin pruebas, tiene que dar la prueba completa para creer porque viniendo la opinión de fan de apple sacara todo lo malo de otra marca pero nunca ha sacado defecto del iPhone y eso que si los tiene y graves",2024-02-22T05:12:13Z,2024-02-22
LKRmYI9bYoI,Yo pase de tener un Huawei p40 pro a s24 ultra y la verdad hay una diferencia grande entre ambos teléfonos y es que el Huawei le lleva mucho en cámara velocidad calidad de vídeo cámara frontal en desbloqueo facial desbloqueo de huella lo único es que el s24 ultra le lleva es en los servicios de Google pero si Huawei tuviera los servicios de Google sería el mejor teléfonos del mercado y acabo de salir de Huawei solo por los servicios de Google,2024-12-03T20:09:37Z,2024-12-03
LKRmYI9bYoI,"Lo del rendimiento es cierto, así siempre han sido los dispositivos Samsung. Para evitar eso, lo que yo hago, es bloquear el GOS(Game Optimizing Service); de esta manera tendremos un rendimiento más estable por más tiempo pero la temperatura aumetara muchísimo.
Espero que NewEsc haga una comparación de tener activa la app GOS y no tenerla activa.",2024-02-21T21:53:33Z,2024-02-21

LKRmYI9bYoI,"Lo del calentamiento del S24 Ultra se debe al procesador snapdragon 8 gen 3 tiene un TDP termico de 12.6 watts, en cambio el snapdragon 8 gen 2 tiene un TDP de 6.3 Watts osea la mitad. El 8 gen 2 calienta mucho menos que el 8 gen 3.",2024-04-29T20:16:07Z,2024-04-29

LKRmYI9bYoI,"Los galaxy buds2pro pro tienen un grave problema de incompatibilidad con la opción de desarrollo en ( inhabilitar volumen absoluto ) es algo muy grave y solo lo veo en la familia de Galaxy s23 y los s24,  La única forma horrible de hacer que la opción de desarrollador ( inhabilitar volumen absoluto, sea compatible con los galaxy buds2pro, es estar desvinculando los galaxy buds2pro y volviendolos a víncular, Ya que si el dispositivo galaxy los empareja y les descarga automáticamente la aplicación ( galaxy wearable ) inmediatamente se aplica el error 😡 entonces a tomar esto en cuenta dispositivos Galaxy s23 y s24 con los galaxy buds2pro  y la opción de desarrollador ( inhabilitar volumen absoluto ) y su respectiva aplicación ( galaxy wearable ) 😡",2024-12-04T16:42:22Z,2024-12-04
LKRmYI9bYoI,Lo que mas me molesta de el s24 ultra es el throtling osea no se calienta pero baja su rendimiento demasiado es decepcionante para un dispositivo de 1300 dolares y aun mas viendo que el oneplus 12 siendo de 900 mantiene mejor el rendimiento ._.,2024-07-08T22:30:11Z,2024-07-08

LKRmYI9bYoI,"Lo del rendimiento es subjetivo, ya que Samsung limita al procesador por lo que no es problema de sobrecalentamiento, sino que es una capa de protección para la batería. En juegos y algunas tareas más pesadas no debería haber pérdidas ya que lleva el Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 fabricado por TSMC. Ese bajón de rendimiento que tú dices solo sucede en pruebas de rendimiento máximo se limita el procesador de manera automática.",2024-02-21T20:57:08Z,2024-02-21

Alta Proporciona un procesamiento de datos más rápido. Es útil si algunas aplicaciones se ejecutan lentamente. Consume más batería y puede aumentar la temperatura del dispositivo. Máxima Recomendada para un uso breve con aplicaciones que necesitan procesar muchos datos. Consume más rápido la batería y tiende a aumentar la temperatura del dispositivo. Supuestamente yo la tengo en el mas bajo por que no le meto tanta potencia al móvil de aplicaciones que sean fuertes son Tiktok Instagram y YouTube y la verdad para ser potentes no me quita puntos en la prueba de Antutu, Hize una prueba de antutu y la verdad con la velocidad de procesamiento baja me consume menos batería y el equipo no hace tanto trabajo",2025-03-04T13:20:31Z,2025-03-04

u6PJ60z66eM,"Ordered black, just got it today, but they sent gray... Hour on the phone working out the details for the black to be sent (trade in, 2x storage promo, etc all needed to be reattached). Half way through the chat with Tmobile, I saw this video and decided it wasnt worth the risk of getting screwed relying on them to apply the promos correctly to the Black phone. So (i think) im keeping the gray, but still haven't opened it...

I have seen a few people say they ordered black and wish they got gray after seeing in person",2024-02-08T04:24:57Z,2024-02-08

u6PJ60z66eM,I pre-ordered Titanium Black can't wait to get mine. I'm coming from a Galaxy S20 FE. My current phone is still in great condition and works perfectly but I'm worried in the 2 weeks while I wait for my new phone something is gonna happen to my current one. It's either gonna get lost or stolen or break. I just have this feeling I've had it for 3 years now with no real major issues only for it something to happen to it 2 weeks before I upgrade.,2024-01-21T08:37:31Z,2024-01-21

emrLEDH52e0,"After experimenting with the S24 Ultra, I discovered that its AI capabilities significantly enhance my work productivity. Consequently, I decided to transition from my iPhone 15 Pro Max to the S24 Ultra for business purposes. While I have been a loyal Apple customer since their inaugural phone release, the lack of design innovation, particularly the prominent notch, has become increasingly frustrating. In a business context, I prioritize features that justify the price, rather than aesthetic considerations such as titanium.",2024-02-11T17:05:59Z,2024-02-11

No idea why I ever switched, but I’m very happy to be back.",2024-07-15T21:01:38Z,2024-07-15

emrLEDH52e0,"I’ve always had the notes and ultras and decided to try out iPhone and got the iPhone 15 pro max. After watching these videos, it really makes me miss my ultra.

emrLEDH52e0,"Best tech channel, in my opinion.
Normally, when I check out something specific like phone tips & tricks or even features on youtube, I'll skim through the entire video. This video, I sat through from start to finish and actually got locked in around the point that you mentioned the live translator / interpreter feature. 

My s24 ultra is on the way right now and just that feature alone has me more excited that I can put into words. Something as small as a nearly-seemless 2-way translation in real time can really open alot of doors and change the way people interact. Might even help people pick up a language as fast as duolingo, if they use it nearly as often!

Great video! 
Can't wait to see the updated video when samsung AI really starts pumping out the cool stuff they've got locked away for later :)))",2024-03-05T22:06:48Z,2024-03-05

shlTpFa3F78,"Both are great phones, and you can't tell me otherwise. They each have their pros and cons, to the extent that they're basically equal to each other. Each generation, one phone edges ahead of the other, the S23 comes out and it's better than the iPhone 14, then the iPhone 15 comes out and surpasses the S23, followed by the S24 which outperforms the iPhone 15, and so on, so they are right on each other's tails, and yes sometimes the cycle stops for a bit but a few more phones later, the cycle continues. Also, there's no good reason to label either one as trash. Like why do you gotta do that, like what? Because you want everyone to switch to the one you're comfortable with? You need to understand that people have their own comfort zones. Why are we in a time where people always have to make others feel bad because their phone isn't considered good enough by THEIR preferred brand? I’m honestly just tired of people trashing on Apple or Samsung.",2024-03-24T09:24:15Z,2024-03-24

shlTpFa3F78,"Fun fact, before LG stopped making their phones, they were basically the first ones to come up with ""always on"" display. I forget which phone it was, but it had an extra display on the top that was always on and showed the time and messages and a few other notifications. 

As a matter of fact, LG basically pioneered most of the features that androids and apple have. You just have looknback at their phones. 

Their downfall was always trying to come up with new concepts every year and never really had a flag ship to compete with others. LG did make some great phones in my opinion tho, especially the screens and cameras",2024-06-12T21:15:26Z,2024-06-12

Before you ask, I used to build secondary focusing mirrors for telescopes when I was younger, and I know a decent amount about glass. Nearly every item you buy that has glass in it has a coating, and that is what is scratching. The increased strength is more about impact resistance.

I used to think iPhones felt a little smother when I got my S22 Ultra, but with this new one UI 6.0 update, my phone genuinely feels 3 generations newer and fresh out of the box. i have no idea how they did it, but it feels so much smoother than even the top of the line iPhones I have felt now.

HvoBci_GC8A,"I have never had any other phone than a Samsung. I have looked and tested others but have always stayed with Samsung. At the moment, l have the 21+ and was waiting for a big upgrade, and this seems to be it. I was always put off by some of the snobbery that comes with some iPhone users.
Your reviews are always SO thorough, including really simple things to more technical stuff that goes over my head, lol, but is still really interesting. I now have a much deeper knowledge of phones thanks to you. Your reviews are honest, fair, personal and always entertaining. As l have a wide taste in music, the bass is only one component and phones with louder bass is more of a put off. For me, the iPhone music quality has always been lacking. 
 When spending well over a £1000 on a device we use everyday, your reviews are essential to many of us. You are one of thee best content creators out there and you truly do "" influence "" people's choices in a very positive way. Thank you for keeping it real.
I know it's maybe not in your area of expertise but l would love you to do a piece on music players.

HvoBci_GC8A,Thanks for the great reviews.  You commented on the cell reception and for someone living in an area with a very week signal it has me a little worried.

HvoBci_GC8A,"The only one I found that could replace my iPhone is the Pixel 8 Pro. I didn't find the same problems with it that I find with Android smartphones. The voice command works perfectly (unlike other Androids where, for some reason, I can never get the voice command to work on the Gboard keyboard). Plus, when setting up a new phone, you can have an exact copy of your old Pixel, just like you do with a new iPhone.

This isn't the case with Samsung, etc., where you have to put all the apps back into folders again, reorganize your folders, etc.

In the end, I found the photo and video quality to be less good than on the iPhone, so I kept my iPhone 15 Pro Max and returned the Pixel. But now, I'm looking forward to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. I'll be very happy to see Google reclaim its crown as the king of photography.

They have the means and the talent; I don't know what's missing for them to achieve it.

Having a disability, voice command allows me to write very quickly without getting exhausted, so for me, it's essential. Moreover, I don't understand why, when copying data from an old Android smartphone to a new one, you don't get an exact copy of what you had on the old one. You have to reorganize everything, recreate folders from scratch, etc. It's a basic feature, and Android is advanced enough to have this kind of functionality.

Only downside was 1 i had to hit record a second time halfway through and 2 same went with the summarization. It did half and had to do the second half seperately.

100% agree Samsung should have leaned more into marketing the anti-reflectiveness. Great feature!

Unfortunately, everything else is either irrelevant to me, a 50/50 call whether it's an upgrade/downgrade, or coming to previous phones so I still don't see any compelling reason to even consider upgrading from last year (and I'm a Samsung enthusiast that has tried almost every S/Note series for the past 10 years).

I want to say I'm not afraid anymore, but at least now I know it's not poisonous 😅 Yes, you could do this with an old phone, but it requires more time to complete the steps and find what you're actually looking for.",2024-07-22T01:40:52Z,2024-07-22

HvoBci_GC8A,"One of the main improvement which I noticed coming from the s23 ultra is the face recognition software. It’s very accurate now, much better than before. I also thought that having a flat screen now would mean I can easily put tempered screen protector but alas it messes with the fingerprint sensor. The software tries very hard to emulate ios. It has the wallpaper on the always on display now. The widgets look very similar to ios( the ones on the lock screen) The photos on iPhone 15 plus is better though. 
The Cameras are larger so much that I have mistakenly covered the lenses with my finger more than once. This hasn’t happened before with my s22 u or s23 u . It is also much easier to handle without any case much more than before. It is because the sides are a bit broader or box shaped like the iPhone. Unfortunately for me the battery isn’t so great. After charging to full at 7 a.m by 7 p.m in the evening it comes down to 30% This is with uhd screen resolution, 120hz scrolling, always on display with wallpaper effect on.There….unfiltered points which you won’t get  anywhere.",2024-01-27T15:10:36Z,2024-01-27
