fFCGtAmse5c,"Thank you for this!  I'm 77rrs old and I really needed the help.  My 'digital Grans and great grans don't come up to the country often, I would be lost if I hadn't found your channel.  You earned my 'subscribe!'    I dropped my A12 and it didn't survive  but this phone is all this old man needs. 🤠"
fFCGtAmse5c,That fact that you can get a phone this good for that price is absolutely insane.
fFCGtAmse5c,I upgraded to this phone from my Samsung A11❤  It's so good alongside with my Tab A9 Plus!
fFCGtAmse5c,The color reminds me of the Samsung Note 10+ Aura Glow. It's beautiful. The bottom speaker cutout also matches the new S24 series. Anyway great video!
fFCGtAmse5c,"Yes, I did purposely make this video 15 minutes long *(A15)* My A55 unboxing next week will be 55 minutes long 👀

A15 5G via Amazon: https://geni.us/A15-5g
A15 4G/LTE  via Amazon: https://geni.us/A15-4G-LTE
microSD Card: https://geni.us/EVO-microSD"
fFCGtAmse5c,"A bit late, but i guess I'll say my opinion. 

The A15 5g is most likely going to be one of Samsung's best selling smartphones, especially after all the upgrades. 

The biggest upgrade with the A15 is the display, no doubt. AMOLED is such a improvement, not just for gamers, but for everyday users alike due to much better color saturation and deeper blacks. The 90Hz also helps. 

Performance wise, the 128GB base storage option is very nice, the chipset ain't going to impress everyone, but its good enough for simple gaming and everyday browsing. 

Design wise, its nice and cool for most people. 

The only thing that turns people away from it is speakers and video, the speaker isn't great, dual speakers is great for music and the fact its capped on 30 fps 1080p video is upsetting. I mean i don't hate the fact that its resolution is 1080p, its just if your going to cap it on FHD, At least give a 60 fps option. 

For the price, its a very good value phone, and will still hold up in the future (Especially compared to the A05)"
fFCGtAmse5c,That color is beautiful it's like the prism white from the s10 series.
fFCGtAmse5c,Apple should learn a thing or two from a under $200 phone about how to provide higher refresh rate display in their Non-pro line-up 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,It's a good affordable phone for the average person. I think spending lots of money on a phone is dumb.
fFCGtAmse5c,I will be upgrading to this phone from my tracfone journey LG. Great review.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Another great vid Wade!

This is such an awesome value... Samsung really killed it this year on the A15.  They did really well in choosing the right trade-offs for most people, while still keeping it at this very affordable price point."
fFCGtAmse5c,It would be nice if you could do a software comparison to more expensive samsung phones. Interested to see what they've omitted.
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm tempted to buy this as a backup.
fFCGtAmse5c,"This is unrelated but this is what I think a killer S24 FE would be: Even Bezels they don’t have to be that thin kinda like s21 fe side bezels, Snapdragon gen 2, 5000mah, fix that silver ring around the front camera and make it look like the other flagships, also the cameras can be slightly improved but they already are pretty decent. Although I don’t think Samsung would ever do something this ambitious. Overall great video on the A15 5g!"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Working wireless, the budget phones were always the most exciting. Seeing people who cannot afford much get better features each year was nice to see. Especially when Samsung went from the A12 to A13. Phone went from awful to useable. A14 got better and hit 1080p, but now with more ram if you get those models these phones should hopefully be able to just work now."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Not talking about this phone but still budget Samsung related, I actually have a Galaxy Tab A7 Lite lying around which I got during my early uni years and just days before it received the One UI 6.0 update as well. Mind you it was released back in June 2021 and it still gets OS updates (which I thought One UI Core 5.0 was going to its last update before Samsung forgets about this tablet.) It's a fairly slow device, but with its price it is such a wonderful media consumption device. With 3rd party equalizers the built in speakers are actually nice. When I bought it  I really didnt expect it to be supported for such a long time."
fFCGtAmse5c,I just ordered one of these the other day switchinf from my 6 year old Motorola that started having issues a couple months ago. I'm so frustrated with! Thank you for this video.
fFCGtAmse5c,This is my phone now and im so inlove with it. ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,Best review so far well explained without pressure ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,History will be made when Samsung finally decides to put punch hole display 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,watching this in my samsung a15 !!
fFCGtAmse5c,"I was going to buy a much more expensive phone but I’m quite happy with this! I’m not gaming, or even phoning much. And I’m usually at home so I can use my home internet with the apps.❤🇨🇦"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Bought this and loving it.

Only thing is I'm not able to have my YouTube notifications pop up on my notifications bar. I've checked all my settings and notifications are allowed .... so"
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm getting it on April 10th only 1 months so excited
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm watching on a a15 😂😂😂
fFCGtAmse5c,6:24 How are you supposed to listen to calls without a speaker near selfie camera?
fFCGtAmse5c,This phone paired with the LG Gram Style 16 laptop is just perfect
fFCGtAmse5c,One speaker two speakers it doesn’t matter because anyone who listens to music through the speakers on their phone should have their ears cut off
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just got mine yesterday, and so far I love the panel, 5g and 50mp camera. I'm more than willing to deal with the single speaker and poor video quality"
fFCGtAmse5c,I love the fact that you are always so honest when reviewing phones.
fFCGtAmse5c,This is by far the best easily! And the colour i got mine is the same light blue it's got the ethereal touch
fFCGtAmse5c,Play tech daily my name each. Me purchased the A15-5G. From Metro by T-Mobile. Tanks dis video iss very very helpful. I love ya Content plz keep pit up.
fFCGtAmse5c,Ironically I just got the Samsung galaxy a14 5g. And I love it. 😂😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
fFCGtAmse5c,I see that international version of Samsung A25 is sold cheaper and just 50 more than A15. Despite that Exynos has bad rep it is still faster than Dimensity 6100+.
fFCGtAmse5c,The samsung galaxy a15 5g awesome phone the color is similar to the samsung galaxy s10 plus prism white and the samsung galaxy note 10 and 10+ and not bad at all
fFCGtAmse5c,A 15 5 is a masterpiece from samsung ❤❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,"Man, you're right on time with this one! I'm currently sitting behind my computer deciding on Samsung Galaxy A15 5G vs Motorola Moto G Play (2024) vs OnePlus Nord N30 5G. Which one would you recommend? I need something cheap and basic, mainly for calls and looking up stuff online occasionally."
fFCGtAmse5c,I absolutely love my Samsung A15 4G 128GB . I am going to purchase the Samsung A15 5G 256GB version and the Samsung A25 5G 256GB version.
fFCGtAmse5c,I actually got this and my friends thought it is an samsung s24
fFCGtAmse5c,Thanks. I only came here for the apps pre installed ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,❤ Love it. Huge improvements in memory capacity & screen over A14.
fFCGtAmse5c,YES i waited so much for u to do this video W VIDEO MAN
fFCGtAmse5c,I BOUGHT IT THREE YEARS AGO AND IT IS VERY GOOD 👍
fFCGtAmse5c,"Again, the fact that Samsung has an SD card here but not on their $1,000 phone is a travesty."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Seems like a nice change from my A10E, that clearly needs an upgrade watching the screen go bezerk."
fFCGtAmse5c,If you only used your phone to watch YouTube and check emails would you buy the A15 or the A05s? Im being forced to uprage from my nokia G20 due to 3g no longer being supported.
fFCGtAmse5c,"I go one android than an iPhone then android then iPhone.

These android phones are getting better and better for a low price.

Moto G73 ATM. I'm happy"
fFCGtAmse5c,Finally a praise worthy review 🎉🎉
fFCGtAmse5c,Why didn't it come with screen recording
fFCGtAmse5c,I ordered mine free through my carrier. As long as I had service and a certain plan. Was looking into a new budget friendly phone.
fFCGtAmse5c,"This is (compared to A14) big upgrade to A10 series. I wanted to buy A14 5G but no ultra-wide camera, slow as f charging and goofy bezels was big no. Now this is all fixed with A15 5G :D"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Waiting for a A25 review
Idk when, But im gonna wait."
fFCGtAmse5c,Why my samsung a15 lte doesn't have  a video stabilization like yours? Where I can find? Is there any set about it?
fFCGtAmse5c,Oof nice phone. i’m going to get one on 2024 christmas man 🎄
fFCGtAmse5c,"I have one. It's my first ever Samsung. It's okay. It lags but it's good for 270 CAD. The camera is descent. Annyoing things: common lag, huge bezels, U shaped notch, etc. I am switching to a Galaxy A55 soon. Overall okay. Not a very fluid phone, but the rest is okay."
fFCGtAmse5c,Just got my own today
fFCGtAmse5c,is it water proof?
fFCGtAmse5c,In my region I have the 4g variant. Whats your opinion about that?
fFCGtAmse5c,I don’t understand how the a11 and a12 had hole punch selfie camera and had thinner bezels.
fFCGtAmse5c,"My personal phone is a samsung S24 , iv had it a while and was ready to upgrade when my work gave me a new A15, i think its a great lil phone, im actually considering getting A15 as my personal fone lol"
fFCGtAmse5c,"i hope for their future a16, they do the punch hole in the side like what they did to a11"
fFCGtAmse5c,I’m watching this while having a Gabb phone 4 pro 😭😂
fFCGtAmse5c,I have a a51 and I think I might get this new a15 just because of the price the new a 55 5G in Canada 🇨🇦 now is like 600 dollars its getting up there so I think I'll go with the a15 great video and thank you
fFCGtAmse5c,I wish they bring back A11 front camera design for their upcoming entry level phone
fFCGtAmse5c,"I want to buy this phone for my mom, she doesn't want a flagship phone, just a phone that will replace her old clunky galaxy A20. 😅"
fFCGtAmse5c,I love your videos today I'm gonna get two one for my wife and one for her daughter❤❤❤❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,I have a new A13 and a new A15. Both are 5G phones. The A13 beats it in side by side speed tests every time.........
fFCGtAmse5c,"Those waching on 2025
⬇️"
fFCGtAmse5c,"My uncle purchased the Indian retail unit of this in the blue black colour and I gave him a heads up on the technology side of a smartphone. He upgraded from a Nokia 6.2 so he definitely lost on the build quality, but he gained on a lot more aspects. I use an A34 5G [i wanted an A33 5g originally but got the middle variant of the same once i noted the improvements]."
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just bought 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my wife at walmart for 139.99 each!!!"
fFCGtAmse5c,Is this phone for recording videos?
fFCGtAmse5c,I have a older A51 do you think this would be a good enough phone for me to buy or should I spend alot more money and buy a new A55 because they are very pricey in Canada 🇨🇦
fFCGtAmse5c,"Somehow this phone's display is better than the one on my a54. My a54 has terrible viewing angles, tilting the screen ever so slightly gives the screen a green cast, and whites look weird, kind of greenish, if you squint, it's because there are tiny green and purple pixels scattered on the display. None of that was present in the a15's display, whites look actually white and more comforting to the eye, viewing angles are not as bad, i didn't see the weird scattered green and purple pixels, and yeah in general the difference was night-and-day"
fFCGtAmse5c,If I had known of this phone sooner I would have never traded my s22 to get the Z Flip 5 I would have gone with this phone
fFCGtAmse5c,"When turn on the phone, why only showed samsung galaxy?? Why not samsung galaxy A15 5G?? 😮😮"
fFCGtAmse5c,there is a secondary speaker you couldn't do phone calls without it. But its not configured as stereo speakers.
fFCGtAmse5c,Even this has a better screen-to-body than the A54 🤣🤣
fFCGtAmse5c,Bro battery died 5hrs charge 😢 5:05
fFCGtAmse5c,I have it for some time now and while the screen is excellent the overall design is horrible. They put the power button on the side barely extruding so it's extremely hard to click it. Most of the time I need to look where is the button before clicking it. It's a shame because such a small thing is so frustrating. Can't wait to get rid of it unfortunately.
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm getting this on my birthday 86 days
fFCGtAmse5c,"I wonder, will Americans consider this phone above the Iphone SE? Samsung's budget phones are getting better and better."
fFCGtAmse5c,"A25 is leagues better. It really is the best option this year so far. Please, if you're going to buy a budget samsung phone, please save your money up for atleast an A25 5G. If your looking for hardware which is near flagship material but with a headphone jack, I'd say the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 pro is a much better and cheaper option."
fFCGtAmse5c,"NIce, im planning to buy the 6GB RAM + 128GB storage (Samsung galaxy A15 5G Double slim) version :)"
fFCGtAmse5c,Price
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm always on the go is this phone good to watch movies? Does it have Dolby Atmos? How is the screen resolution  and does it take good pictures and videos??
fFCGtAmse5c,"Watching this bc I got it for free when I swapped to cricket.
Once I left I just took the Sim card out and popped it back into my s23 ultra lol"
fFCGtAmse5c,Super Super Sir👌👌👍👍👏👏👏👏👏
fFCGtAmse5c,"Meanwhile in Australia, it’s $341 in the Samsung Australia Amazon store, but the far superior A35 only costs $100 more"
fFCGtAmse5c,"In South Africa it is $200😭😭😭
People don't believe me when I say these phones are overpriced. On a contract, it's ridiculous."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Me with my Galaxy S24 Ultra: 😂😂😂😂

Joke aside, for someone, who just needs a simple phone or doesn't have much money this is a great joice but for me, who needs fast and big phones with a very good camera the A15 isn't it, because i had A series Phones before but they always get slow and laggy after 2 Months and the cameras, durability, cheap plastics and Performance aren't the best. Because i do almost everything on my phone, watching videos, making videos mostly in 4K, playing games, writing documents, multitasking and much more"
fFCGtAmse5c,I want to upgrade from samsung a 12 should i choose this or anathor company phone someone please reply ????
fFCGtAmse5c,"Does it only take one sim?...
If yes do they have the one that takes 2 sims"
fFCGtAmse5c,The first thing is 6.5 or even less is the best size for any cell phone
fFCGtAmse5c,how long does the battery last
fFCGtAmse5c,"Does it have ""Data switching and backup calling""?"
fFCGtAmse5c,are they any good
fFCGtAmse5c,Awesome Phone I am Getting This One Next Month
fFCGtAmse5c,Great amazing ❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,"Cracked my A13 screen. So im buying this one, hopefully i will be impressed"
fFCGtAmse5c,Just bought this phone from Walmart $60. Works great!

HuDhsrhD5xM,It's  a great budget phone. I've been using this for 1.5 years. sometimes it feels like sluggish all of a sudden but not always. And i cannot complain about its camrea becase of its price. Overall its a good phone for its price.
HuDhsrhD5xM,Better than any of the new iPhones
HuDhsrhD5xM,A series is the best looking phone in my opinion
HuDhsrhD5xM,It runs a lot smoother on one UI 7
HuDhsrhD5xM,The phone I got rn it's honestly pretty good for the price had this phone for like 3 or 2 years now only got 1 crack and that was because I took off my phone case I bought a phone case for $27 so that's probably the best phone case I ever had lol
HuDhsrhD5xM,È diventato nostalgico il bro per un secondo
HuDhsrhD5xM,"buying phone with carrier is tragic option, but buying budget phone with carrier is the worst idea of all time"
HuDhsrhD5xM,"He with new phone👌🤛🤛🤜
Me with new phone😃❤❤✅"
HuDhsrhD5xM,From the UK and had mine a year now no real issues. I have the 4g 4 gig ram. Model.
HuDhsrhD5xM,it may be basic but it's still a very beautiful back color
HuDhsrhD5xM,Wow❤😊
HuDhsrhD5xM,This phone is phenomenally good for its price
HuDhsrhD5xM,I was thinking: man this phone looks and feels cheap. then I realized it's supposed to be that way

HuDhsrhD5xM,I'm holding it right now
HuDhsrhD5xM,bro is throwing gang signs from 80 years ago
HuDhsrhD5xM,When you bought a A15 from AT&T
HuDhsrhD5xM,"do NOT buy this phone, there are so many issues with it that you're better off buying an a14"
HuDhsrhD5xM,Phone is straight garage. Would only buy if you on a very tight budget.
HuDhsrhD5xM,"You didn't buy a fake phone, did you?"
HuDhsrhD5xM,None of the Samsung phones coming in 2025 should have a U notch drop (in any price range)
HuDhsrhD5xM,"no AOD, I break A15 for a new one🗿"
HuDhsrhD5xM,Remember this phone has No gyroscope
HuDhsrhD5xM,Сколько кредит платить осталось или в долг взял?

HuDhsrhD5xM,"the A15 looks kind of the same as the A16, which is the phone i have right now. but i noticed only one difference, the A15 has a headphone jack while the A16 does not."
HuDhsrhD5xM,Fun fact I got the same phone but in blue
HuDhsrhD5xM,"Wait, There's still a headphone Jack??!! In 2025??!?! Why doesn't Samsung give this to us on all the S series?"
HuDhsrhD5xM,"I had the samsung a10e, it was slow and had no ram, but it worked"
HuDhsrhD5xM,"*i use this phone myself, its realy good and feels nice
*only downside is that its hard to find cheap phone cases for it l

Edit:
but the phone is great tho
And i got a charger brick (luckly)"
eMS2U2w825g,Péssimo aparelho!!
eMS2U2w825g,Those bezels are ugly
eMS2U2w825g,Price
eMS2U2w825g,Great phone
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Just got my a15 5g yesterday, thank you for this video, really helpful for a new samsung user like me 🙌"
iP0QW7WEyr0,"I think we got a worthy competitor with the Samsung Galaxy A35 ... the OnePlus Nord 4 (metal body) powered by the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 SoC, sport a 6.74"" 1.5K 120Hz OLED screen, a 5,500 mAh battery with 100W charging support. It will have three cameras - 50MP primary, 8MP ultrawide, and 16MP selfie. An in-display fingerprint scanner, stereo speakers and we both know more will be revealed next week [no doubt an Android OS 14 which will be very Color OS ]."
iP0QW7WEyr0,I absolutely love that 'swipe to take a screenshot' option! Thank you!!
iP0QW7WEyr0,Watching from galaxy a15 5g
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Thank you so much for this, I have just bought one of these phones and used your videos to set up and put in place a lot of these great suggestions. This is my first smart phone and I am a pensioner in the UK. This has been so clear and understandable, I am happily using it. Could not have done it without your videos, a thousand thank yous."
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thanks this was very helpful because I just picked up a Galaxy A15
iP0QW7WEyr0,Bought the A15 today so satisfied with it today 🎭
iP0QW7WEyr0,I just got my A15 tonight definitely using these tricks and tips🎉
iP0QW7WEyr0,Switch of animation makes the phone faster as well.
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Already having A15 5G. Great phone, very satisfied"
iP0QW7WEyr0,Bro this phone is awesome !! I recently got one
iP0QW7WEyr0,"battery protection & ""lift to wake"" are very cool ☆ thanks 👍
nb:
can add screenshot button in notification panel
~ swipe down for panel & select edit
& select screenshot button as one of top six."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"to screenshot with ""palm"" more like your whole hand really is take your whole hand on the left of the screen with your hands far right side on the left side not top or bottom just the left side, and swipe firmly from left to right holding hand almost off the left edge to start, pretty easy after a couple tries.."
iP0QW7WEyr0,One thing I noticed is; the widgets on the bottom corners of your lock screen can be changed or removed. Hold down on the lock screen and you will have the option to customize them. I removed the left one and set the right one to turn on and off my flashlight without unlocking the phone.
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Thank you for this!  I just got my A15 Saturday and was having a time with the features!  I am coming from the Samsung S20 and it is a bit different!  Question, on the S20 I was able to assign a tone to each of my family members so that I would know which one was texting or calling!  I can't seem to figure it on the A15?"
iP0QW7WEyr0,Good video bro but has anyone had screen delay freeze or so ...or its just bc screen protection glass?it happend to me every time i use to play a game?
iP0QW7WEyr0,"I just got one of these thank you for the great video. I hate having to learn new things in my old age but my other phone was six years old and wasn't working right and of course the company had no clue why. Well I finally did, it was just to old and there wasn't any more updates for that Android phone. Hahaha!"
iP0QW7WEyr0,A15 4g here. 0:10
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Thanks, this was super helpful"
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thanks for showing the tip about protecting your battery! I sometimes fall asleep with my phone charging. I can be assured now that my phone will only go up to 80% Much appreciated!
iP0QW7WEyr0,THANK YOU !! Im old and I just got this phone! and I'm locking it..HEAVY AF as well. lol
iP0QW7WEyr0,RAM+ in my experience makes my A53 5G laggy so I turned it off. My biggest gripe with Samsung is Samsung keeps installing apps on my phone I can't uninstall.
iP0QW7WEyr0,"New to your channel & thank the GOD'S you are here!!! They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks!! Thank you kindly 🙏 DEFINITELY Subbed 😊 (I'm struggling with the ""Screenshot"" if you could help I'd be eternally grateful!) All I've managed to accomplish is a fuzzy screen lol"
iP0QW7WEyr0,How can I hide notification panel on lock screen?
iP0QW7WEyr0,"This video was so useful, very well explained. I just upgraded to a samsung a15. I never knew about most of these features."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Ram plus, ""if you don't want this on for whatever reason""? 
what reason, I still have no idea if I should have it on or not.
these tips are more useful for a 14 yr old."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"I am quite tech savvy, but this guy is going way too fast. Just because he knows what he’s doing, doesn’t mean the rest of us do."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"you forgot the edge panel, I found it pretty cool too 😊"
iP0QW7WEyr0,Two points are important number 1 either it should charge full in 10 to 20 min If not 2 It should last 24 hours min Onscreen Time
iP0QW7WEyr0,Best phone I've ever had. Glad I purchased it
iP0QW7WEyr0,Any regrets for buying the 4+4 gb ram plus?
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thanks for the swipe gesture instead of button type and the colour font 🎉
iP0QW7WEyr0,Bro said keep phone unlocked at girlfriend's house lol 5:13
iP0QW7WEyr0,Great phone overall😊
iP0QW7WEyr0,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not really major"
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thanks for sharing. A got lot of knowledge because of your  blog thanks
iP0QW7WEyr0,Good video keep going 👍

iP0QW7WEyr0,How many of you are excited to get this phone?This is my first phone
iP0QW7WEyr0,Are these things only on the 5G one ?
iP0QW7WEyr0,"It might be stupid but, when im in an app and i hit the home button and go to  another app for a moment and then either open up my recently used apps or hit the home button and go back go the app i was using it reloaded my entire progress, as if i (where filling out an application or retrieving a security code from my email) it reboots me to the beginning of the app or progress is lost from what i was doing..."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Ever since I got my a15, the youtube app would just act like I've closed it and opened it after backing out of it to go into another app even though I have youtube premium so it should still play in the background. Are there any fixes for this?"
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thank alot! ❤

iP0QW7WEyr0,How do I get that search bar that you have on your main screen. I have to scroll through a couple screens to find mine and it's got all the history and everything below that which I don't like. I just got this phone I had the Samsung AO3 ES which this is a big step up. But it's taken me days to change things on it that I'm not used to. Like on the keyboard part I like to use talk to text and the microphone is at the bottom instead of the top were the Emojis are. Thank you for this I will watch it in its entirety later.

1C2vu1LSsok,"Hey, just wanted to thank you. My phone has been stuck on the loading screen for two days, I tried safe mode, removing the sim card, performing a soft reset, everything I could find.

MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought this phone and it's crazy to me that this was a budget phone. I literally ordered it online, added a nice case and had it delivered in about 40 minutes... all for under $200 total. The amount of bang for your buck is pretty crazy and although I'm used to my iPad finger sensor location, I am really liking the feature built into the power button. Also, battery life matters to me and this is an upgrade over my last phone."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got mine for $128 out the door from T-Mobile today. I have an iPhone 11 and the A15 5G is definitely an upgrade.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just got this phone. It's a very fast equipped phone when your on the go and in a fast pace environment. Like the fingerprint unlock feature is on point. The swiping on point too
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Let’s be honest, for most people this phone checks all the boxes."
MP-aGSJJsvk,The phone to get for people who want the features that matter the most to most smartphone users without wanting to pay up to $1000 more for any of the S24 models. I'd buy it.
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15... Got her today... On my hand the most beautiful creature made by Samsung. Love it. 😊😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review! I have upgraded my Samsung A12 on this because it has 5G. Man, Samsung is very durable. My A12 is still good after 3 years of use. You can never go wrong with Samsung!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got this phone free when changing service and went from an A53 5G to this. I know the A53 has better specs but with day to day use they seem about the same. I'll probably go back to my A53 just because the camera is better but other than that it would be hard to tell them apart. I think the fingerprint reader is better on the A15 and it has an actual headphone jack so those even things out a little.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got one a month ago and it is the best bang for your buck. The display is 🔥
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I switched from S21 to this phone because of the longer battery, but it ticks all of the boxes I need for a phone. No need spending much and this phone doesnt need a cover"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"GSMARENA was my go to before the YouTube review era!!
Good to see you guys!!
Subbed!!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have been using it for 2 months. It's enough for most people.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was attacked and robbed recently of my S24 Ultra and Switch OLED and 1800 in cash. Needless to say, I needed to shop for a new phone but was determined to get an OLED screen. I got the A15 LTE for $199 in Canada. What an incredible phone and value. The S24 Ultra is 2 grand in Canada and this phone keeps up nicely and had Android 14 installed. 
Im grateful that Samsung has a cheaper line of phones but also that they are making them so well. 
Everything about this phone is incredible for 2 hundred bucks.
Spring for the 5G model though. I should have thrown in the extra 25. My LTE is a little slow at times."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review. This A15 5G looks identical to my A25, but I am glad I bought the latter, the extra 50 bucks price difference seems to be worth it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Most people using phones at this price range won't be needing the 5G speed, I appreciate the option thou, but getting the cheaper 4G model is probably the wiser choice."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 User here. I'm super happy with it's recent updates, improving performance and so on."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I bought this phone just for my curiosity and it's pretty good aside from the meh camera quality. I own a Pixel 8 Pro and honestly this phone is pretty good for those on a very strict budget.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Galaxy A15 my dream phone 😍 cant wait to save money and buy this to play my favourite games, Pree Payyee and Pabjee Mobeel at 8k max settings 500fps wow"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got it. Replacement for my overheated s21, its really good for a budget phone"
MP-aGSJJsvk,In video speaker test like the old days! Classic 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought the Galaxy A15 a few days ago and so far I like it. It's probably too early to say for sure but so far it's a pretty good phone. I bought the Samsung galaxy A20 around 3 years ago and I loved it! Until the screen pixels crapped out on me after 2 or 3 months. I paid $80 to repair the screen and the new screen crappmonths. after 6 months. I was soon mad!!! 😂😭😠 So,  I'll wait past 6 months to see how this version really works for me. 😅😊"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Dear Samsung please get rid of this dam notch.Bring the punch hole in all of your devices.It is a humble request
MP-aGSJJsvk,Bought it yesterday and I'm in love with it perfect phone❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 5G was released march 2023 herr in Phil. I bought mine march31 2023. .and I am very satisfied for the quality. My friends went crazy when I use this under the rain 🤣🤣🤣 until now nothing change, it seems like brand new when it comes to phone overl all performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"It’s good to see Amoled screen on Samsung’s budget phones. However, I think I’m gonna wait for A55 if it has some interesting upgrade too."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I love Samsung Galaxy A15 5G, I did some tests on it, didn't even break, I even poured water on it, didn't do ANY damage!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got my Galaxy phone....loving it so far...
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought it today as a toy for my daughter. I got it brand new for $40 from walmart. It is locked to straighttalk. But who cares I am not putting a sim in it, as it is going to be used as a gaming phone by kids."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"My wife got this phone. A couple weeks in it started to get random issues locking up due to ghost touch, making the phone unusable until she restarts it. Seems to be a common issue online.

We're outside the 2 week return period, so now we need to try and bring it in the next time the issue shows up as they won't do anything unless they see the issue, but it happens sporadically and makes even restarting the phone difficult when it happens. A replacement might have the same issue so we were hoping to return the phone and go for a different model, but they said we have to go through warranty first.

Even the technician gave us a look the second he saw we had a A15 because he knew it was trouble.

Would not recommend this phone unless you don't mind your phone becoming unusable every once in a while."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got mine yesterday and I really enjoy it. It's much faster than the a20 i had.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Some corrections:
The A15 5G uses a different processer than the A15 4G. Both phones have OIS, not EIS, both phones get supported for 4 years OS updates, 5 years for security, and you can change the display colours on both devices,and both phones can take 50 mp photos for more detail which they didnt do in the camera test for some reason."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why is the Samsung A15 4G faster than the A15 5G when I always hear that 5G connectivity phones are faster ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Watching this on my Samsung A34. I love Samsung
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This may be wrong of me to ask here but what about Angie? Like personally, are you guys still keep in touch with her? I know she moved on to start her own channel but she hasn't posted anything in a while. Both here and on her Instagram. I'm just worried about her. So please if you guys have any news, please share. Thank you."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for this review. I had to buy one 4 days ago, when the screen of my device which i had for almost 4 years gave out. I actually really like it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Updated comment: Guess the issue at 3:22 verifies Notebookcheck's test of the A15 LTE having better UFS controllers than the 5G version.

Original comment: Any other complaints that aren't based on skill issues?😂
Some website said the 4G version has faster storage speed despite both models being UFS 2.2."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Yay ive been waiting for this video
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I will buy this phone end of may, from A03 to A15.
The best budget phone between A05s & A25"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The one thing that I like about this phone and Samsung phones in general is the sound quality in videos, they sound pretty nice, my S20 FE captures sounds with great quality and I couldn't be more happier. This A15 has great quality sound in video as well."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Samsung did a good job for thier budget phones.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Saw her for one second and have never been happier to get her back with me
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15 is basically A24 in disguise
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently just got the A15 4G
And I love it
I have no complains
It's fast and reliable.
I also play call of duty mobile with great frame rate and almost no lags
Tho lags are every endurable
It's the best budget phone I've ever used"
MP-aGSJJsvk,But how does it work as a telephone?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you so much Gsmarena
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Hey I have this phone just 2 days ago!
It was a really good phone and I am gonna use this phone for my school thats gonna start in 4 more days
Really shines and does more!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This phone impressed me! For an entry level, you can't go wrong with this!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching with my newly purchased Galaxy A15. 
I have both an Iphone and this, but I prefer to use this 🥰"
MP-aGSJJsvk,What a beauty 😍 i got mine last week 8gb 256gb rom 🎉
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got two of these phones for free with T-Mobile as a family plan and everyone satisfied I really like it
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got two for switching from Metro to T-mobile for free. They should be here Wed. Can't wait. My a12 is old and acting up and my daughter's A07 is definitely giving up the ghost; so prayerfully made the right choice.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I gave my daughter this phone hope she likes it❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Big fan of this video visual direction 🙏
MP-aGSJJsvk,"im buying this phone soon, my dad has a phone like that and it is very great. I suggest ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Nice review, many thanks. Apologies for my ignorance, but why would one need or prefer 4g vs 5g or vice versa? Thanks."
MP-aGSJJsvk,THANK YOU SO MUCH 4 THE TOUR 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,Which is better to buy A15 4g or A15 5g
MP-aGSJJsvk,I've had a Galaxy A51 for a few years and I recently bought a A15 5g.I like it but my heart will always be with my A51 lol
MP-aGSJJsvk,I saw a gunshop right across from your studio😂😂 5:29
MP-aGSJJsvk,My elder brother bought this for me 😊❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,The best phone ever I switched from iphone and it's hands down the best phone I ever used people paying all this money for iphones and flagship phones doesn't make sense
MP-aGSJJsvk,Good review. Happy with my A15. Battery life is awesome.
MP-aGSJJsvk,0:45 I’m here to watch the great review on this phone I just found at $100 dollars and with all due respect I started to watch this video and I was thinking about the “uncle Roger”guy lol😜I hope you don’t get offended by my dumb comment 😮
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Bro samsung A34 or moto edge 40 neo ?
Which is best?"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Getting mine on Friday ❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently bought a Google Pixel 8 and bought an a15 for an emergency spare. The a15 does everything that the Google pixel 8 does, at least according to my needs (the camera on the Pixel 8 is better, however). I actually like the larger size of the a15, and for those who worry about the sturdiness of the case in the screen, you can get a rubberized case and screen covers for $10 or $15 total, making it hard to break. If I had to do it all over again, I would buy an a15 or an a25, and skip the pixel 8."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The A15 5G is not slower because it's a 5G model, it's because there was a firmware and software issue. This has now been fixed by Samsung."
MP-aGSJJsvk,1:50 i dont understand some phone companies the flagships won't have headphone Jacks but their mid-range will just keep the headphone jack all together
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why are they still releasing a separate 5g and 4g version? 5g stopped being a premium (or even midrange) feature years ago.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got one and love it. I beat my addiction of apple
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does this one have a screen recorder?
MP-aGSJJsvk,The beat device I've ever bought 🎉❤❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Nice. I you bought this phone as a back up for $40 bucks✊🏼
MP-aGSJJsvk,Even my 3yr old Redmi note 9pro max doesn't lag
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just bought this for my son. Hope he likes it
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got the A15 a few weeks ago and it runs so well.  A big upgrade from my Moto G Pure.  I got tired of Moto.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching from my A15 and I must say, it's just so good for its price"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Your nerdy ness helped me
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have recently bought the Samsung AO5s and Samsung A15 4G.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have a midrange a73 5g since 2022. I must say its still good and i heavily use my phone on a daily basis
MP-aGSJJsvk,"i got this to replace my redmi 8 pro as the battery was dying. great phone, feels solid, camera is not as good as only 30fps but that doesnt bother me. has all the bells and whisltles like NFC. cant fault it for a £100 phone ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Where is the fingerprint secure at
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Brought 4G of  this phone two weeks ago 160$ 6GB RAM and 128GB of ROM

PROS ARE
1 Amoled display but compared to other phones like even galaxy s8 it looks little cheap idk why. 
2 Battery is perfect it consume 10% every hour of screen time
3 One UI 6 is pretty good with no lag.
4 fingerprint scanner is very responsive and very fast i love it.

Cons 
1 No HDR support for display.

2 bulky design and applying case and screen protector make it very heavy.

3 No OIS or EIS for camera. And 50mp photos looks washed out front camera is taking good photos but looks unnatural.

4 phone back is plastic and fingerprint marks are very visible. After wiping it several times tiny scratches was visible which is not good. I applied plastic protection in the back to solve further scratches.

5 Front screen have no protection its normal glass I was very sad that it didn't have any type of glass  protection. So I applied screen protector to keep it safe."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"To be honest I have it and I'm not really happy with it. It's extremly chunky and power button is horrible to use. I can never use it without looking, you can barelly feel it. I would not recommend it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for the review: comprehensive, succinct, and interesting."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can you watch youtube videos while browsing or using other apps?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you for this review. I found it most helpful. Gale
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you gsm
MP-aGSJJsvk,Great Phone i recently buy this and very smooth runing
MP-aGSJJsvk,"it is very decent, perfect for daily light/moderate use. I love the battery performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Good job GSM ARENA
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does this device allow screen recording?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just bought it, nice🎉"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just shattered my 21ultra so i think im gumna pull the trigger on this budget phone for a while
MP-aGSJJsvk,is it good for gaming?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Whos here after the shortage
MP-aGSJJsvk,Bro I can overlook Samsung removing the power brick from the boxes of their Flagship and Midrange phones because the customers buying them have enough income but doing the same on their low-end devices where people want the Samsung experience on a budget is just unacceptable.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you much for the info.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can they use the same phone cases?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Redmi note 11 pro 5 g or this? Im using redmi but i have A15 as well.

SuIl1KRWhSc,"A good enough phone for those who just need a basic smartphone with basic usage. Nothing fancy here, but still solid."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"just got the a15 5g ,had it about a week way less glitchy than my old nokia 100 , pretty good for a $150 phone im happy"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I got this phone for the basic smart phone features of apps for grocery shopping, qr code downloads for municipal transportation system real time operations Where is that train or bus? ).  Calculating out the cost savings in shopping with coupons, exceeded the cost upgrades for buying the phone.  It provides the basic phone services and that is all I want tor need from a smart phone."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"3:30 25W charging is a nice update, but no charger in the box. And I still thank Samsung for saving the world more."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got A15, 5G today. I like it.."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Ive been using a15 for 1 month now and it's a great phone
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Just bought one of these for my teenage son, his last phone unfortunately tanked. Really brilliant budget smart phone"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Good phone. Samsung's budget phones are becoming better. A few comments about the video. First, I'm happy you brought the speaker test sounds back. Second, you forgot about the selfie photo quality. But great review. Looking forward to that of the S24 ultra. Thanks."
SuIl1KRWhSc,I bought this phone a few days ago and theres no complaints ❤😊
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I bought the s20 fe this week  for the same price, and it's really good ,battery not the best but I'm planing to change it  ,I think buy old good phone better then new cheap phone 😊"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I purchased one today and I am very happy. $170 out the door. Does the same thing as all the other Samsung phones, just a little slower. I love the single speaker at bottom. Very loud."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"man headphone jack + microsd is wild to see today, and totally sells me on it"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Most people don't use half the shit on their phone. Buying a $2000 phone is ridiculous. This is just fine.
SuIl1KRWhSc,for what its worth at least Samsung is stepping up their official software support game.
SuIl1KRWhSc,It's funny how I watch more reviews from this guy than any other tech YouTuber and I still don't know his full name.
SuIl1KRWhSc,2:03 I'm so happy you brought this banger back♥️👑
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Looking at benchmark results, it can be summed up as ""What if the S9 had a battery?"""
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Many people just ask if it's this or that... You buy and see a cheap product with many updates, a nice design and a relatively solid memory space. That phone pushes well and works, and whether it has a headphone jack and whether it runs certain games without crashing, it doesn't matter whether it has or doesn't have a headphone jack, there are always headphones with a type C input... For certain games, you buy the S series and you don't complicate it for $200, you can't expect it to applaud you and the battery is saved just like the phone."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Has been a great work phone, I have an IPhone 15 pro Max for my daily personal but this Samsung was brought as mine for management and so far it's been great for what it is"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got this phone to replace my a03..a15 4g is a good phone after a month of usage. Videos, camera, social media, casual gaming are execellent no lag no heating battery is good. I love samsung compare to chinese phones."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Hooray...Snow This Time... Absolutely Splendid...
SuIl1KRWhSc,My favorite YouTuber by far I watch all of your reviews
SuIl1KRWhSc,"i have a 52s 5g and an A15  4g....so far A15 runs as smoothly as my 52, if you dont overload it with apps, its running fast and smooth as hell..also the 128 gb storage and the 4 gb ram is tremendous for a cheap phone like that- but what is a 10/10 is its battery!!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,For a13 the a15 a real succesor finally
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I love that it has a decently modern 6nm chipset, great for battery life, but those AMOLED screens are more of a liability, shadows and more sensitive to impacts. OIS would be nice. The SD card and headphone jack are great."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn. Surveillance quality videos.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Hello Will, please help me.  I want to know where I can buy the same earrings you have in this videos...? 🙏🏼"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Bought Today, Great Phone🎉"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn that blue looks hot
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Great review of Samsung a24, i mean a15"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"You only get a charging cable in the box now, not adapter, headphones etc? Haven't bought a new phone since S6."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Headphone jack and microSD in 2024? On a $120 phone? What a steal!
SuIl1KRWhSc,This is my new phone because i lost my old phone and it's good
SuIl1KRWhSc,just bought this right now from amazon canada for 170$ it'll be here in a few days ill let you know how it went.
SuIl1KRWhSc,What is the pulse width modulation level at different brightness levels?  Thank you in advance.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"3:53 PDAF& OIS, it only has AF, and it also gets 4 years os updates it says on samsung"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from my brand new A15 im so loving it❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,"no deep camera/video test, i just finished with this channel"
SuIl1KRWhSc,The bezels are iconic 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,"The Amoled is a big win on these phones.
Only if the A5x would get S-series features too"
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just got the 5G version. Replacing my Bricked A51. Overall it's a nice phone.
SuIl1KRWhSc,As a lite user this phone is enough for me
SuIl1KRWhSc,What is memory type?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Can you include walking video test in the future?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I want to know if Samsung  A15 will also have Samsung Cloud Back up, like we have on the Flagship Phones"
SuIl1KRWhSc,For a budget phone it looks hella good.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching this in my Samsung A70 from 2019😂
SuIl1KRWhSc,Just upgraded from the A13 and the difference in quality is crazy
SuIl1KRWhSc,A15 5g is really awesome❤❤.no complaints 🎉🎉
SuIl1KRWhSc,"In your opinion, will this phone be a good alternative for a travel phone? One that mostly is used to take pics, Google Maps, Translate, and to communicate through WhatsApp,Facebook, and use UBER or other transport. apps? I got my normal cell phone  but need a second one just for travel and one that be inexpensive but good enough to manage esim,pics and what we mostly use overseas while traveling."
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just purchase this phone on Amazon for $130.00 for a friend in the Caribbean..i think she would be happy with my choice..all she need it to make calls and text and this phone is plenty for her needs..good review by the way
SuIl1KRWhSc,Good solid phone. Got one for less then $150 with case and it’s worth it.
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this phone. 6gb ram really makes butter smooth.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from A15❤❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,3:57 There's no OIS.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Nice review
SuIl1KRWhSc,"""These low end budget devices keep getting better and better"". I love how they find a way to praise and demean simultaneously in the same sentence.🤣"
SuIl1KRWhSc,This is similar to a24 and that is amazing 👏 😮
SuIl1KRWhSc,This Samsung a15 have otg and possible to connect lavallier wireless microphone  for vlogging
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I am very regreting not buying Samsung a15,i buyed redmi note 12 and its camera is very bad"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Does this phone has call recording option without informing the call reciever?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Can this phone be used in the USA with a SIM from a network outside the USA?
My phone that I was using for my congo sim broke down. and I wanted to buy this Samsung A15 for my congo sim. will it work? note that I am in the USA. THANKS"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Samsung is a multi-billion dollar company, I can't see why they opted to use ""Virtual proximity sensing"" in their cheaper phones, actual physical sensors have worked so well for years and costs nothing to implement, Virtual proximity sensing is a complete non starter."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Are you able to hide the notch like the old times?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Using ot right now, its a very good phone for its phone extraordinary value!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Bro you have mixed some features of 4G and 5G versions.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"How can a 200€ phone have more functions than a 1500€ one? Phone jack? Expandable storage? FM radio? Sure S24 has some stuff thats more advanced, but you never use it...  the really usable stuff is missing..."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Did not mention that this phone does not have timelapse camera option. Purely softwarily limited, probably so people would buy expensive phone instead."
SuIl1KRWhSc,I got the 5g version today!!
SuIl1KRWhSc,"a24 or a15 
please advise which one is better"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"The general performance is not the best, but what a beauty the Amoled screen and many future updates are. However, we hope that the software is optimized properly, otherwise it will become unusable"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I bought this phone as 2nd phone. It's good enough for basic usage. Good battery life, amoled screen, casual gaming. It also has smartview for streaming your phone to TV. But, the camera quality is average."
SuIl1KRWhSc,It has the exact same external build as the A55?
SuIl1KRWhSc,What country is gsmarena in? Some with kyrillic letters.
SuIl1KRWhSc,I am dying  to know if this is the last samsung phone ever not to have 5g network... what do you think?.. please answer..
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks Redmi. Without you Samsung would not have pushed Amoled screens to that segment.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Can it still work until 6-8 years?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Please make a full review of the s24 plus I'm thinking of Pre order
SuIl1KRWhSc,Memory card support up to ???
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Looking for a suggestion from anyone knowledgeable:

I would like to buy this version of a15 4g with 8gb ram, I found a deal for 150€, I'm concerned about not having 5G connection in the future.

Should I not care about it and just buy it or wait for a16 instead?"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Bought Samsung A15 and I must say that for the price, its worth it. I bought 8/256 variant, camera performs well in good lightening conditions especially the front one and back camera 50mp does a good job even with a flashlight only. Charging speed has improved and battery works really well, I was expecting 4G+ support on this one but unfortunately it doesn't support that, guess that's the only con. The rest, it will work well for couple of years with 4 major updates and 5 years patches. ;)"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"What is it with these tech reviews and not doing research? This device is promised 4 os updates, not 3, and 5yrs security patches, not 4"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks Samsung top notch until 2030
SuIl1KRWhSc,Is ingress protection like gorilla glass? Does it have gorilla glass protection?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Cellphone is supposed to be a Telephone First. I bought the Samsung A15 after watching this review. and found after getting my 5G Sim card, the ear speaker sound quality very Tinny. I wished the reviewer had tested the A15 for ear speaker sound quality. I replaced my, lower priced,  Moto G pure worked great as a phone! The A15 demo phone did not have a Sim card so i could not hear the ear speaker quality. I guess I have to live with it.."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks for posting this video.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Would've gotten this over the Redmi but the bezel and notch turned me off..that shit is ugly in 2024. I got the Redmi and I love every single of it. And it's BEZELLESS.

After seeing this review, thankfully I spent on a better device."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Kapok beli hp samsung, S21 plus layar tiba-tiba garis hijau, tidak jatuh, tidak kena air, tidak sedang update system, ke service Center Samsung Yogyakarta kena biaya 1 juta untuk mengganti lcd padahal masih dalam masa garansi, kemudian ganti lcd baru. Tapi selang 2 bulan layar kembali bermasalah muncul garis hijau. Sekarang saya biarkan..."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Am going to buy a 15 very soon 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,Price please
SuIl1KRWhSc,is this ufs?
SuIl1KRWhSc,is this ok for riders/drivers who uses waze or delivery/ride-hauling apps?
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have 256 GB S23 PLUS *_-goodluck-_*
SuIl1KRWhSc,perfect phone to buy for your parents
SuIl1KRWhSc,is it eMMC ?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching  it on my a35 5g  looking  good
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this and don't mind it
SuIl1KRWhSc,Is it emmc5.1 or ufs 2
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Are they compatible with apps update? For example, would Facebook stop working on this phone if the app had an upgrade?"
SuIl1KRWhSc,What about the front camera?
pfOUdk6PpsY,The most important thing for me is the android update policy (a15 gives u 4 major updates and a16 dives u 6 major updates). that means the a16 will take longer to become obsolete!
pfOUdk6PpsY,"Defo a15, cheaper while having same features and also 3.5mm headphone jack"
pfOUdk6PpsY,Prácticamente es lo mismo.
pfOUdk6PpsY,Pertamax
pfOUdk6PpsY,Le A16 aura android 20 dans le futur ou rien a voir ?
pfOUdk6PpsY,A16❤❤❤❤
pfOUdk6PpsY,Fake video no 3.5 mm jack a16 Samsung
pfOUdk6PpsY,Can I create a pin to unlock my phone?
pfOUdk6PpsY,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
pfOUdk6PpsY,Samsung a16💀
pfOUdk6PpsY,A16 better❤😊
pfOUdk6PpsY,I got the Samsung Galaxy a15 this past summer I should have waited for the a16 to come out
pfOUdk6PpsY,Super duper third class product of samsung after 14 months only it's never work and need 12000 for repairing
pfOUdk6PpsY,Quanto está
0yp6ygN3m3o,"Thank you! The B7000 adhesive is so good. I use it to repair earbud casings too. If anyone is working on electronics get yourself a couple tubes of this stuff. He's right having the right tools on hand makes this stuff so much easier. Get yourself a kit with all different types of heads and tools. The only thing I need now is something to head these up, I'm still using a hair dryer. LMAO."
0yp6ygN3m3o,"BRO, I’m 15, this is the second phone I’ve repaired and this time I repaired it properly no flimsy bits, it’s the glue part that messes me up as I don’t have the proper glue😂 but thanks so much, very informative 🎉"

0yp6ygN3m3o,Legend! This awesome guide helped me immensely ❤ Thank you!
0yp6ygN3m3o,Use a little isopropyl alcohol to help loosen battery so you don’t pull so hard.
0yp6ygN3m3o,"Thanks for the great video.🎉
You used several silver metallic clamps to hold your phone together at the end. Where do you get those, please, and what those called?"
0yp6ygN3m3o,"According to my calculations, 11 Dec 23 was a week and a half shy of 10 months ago. I’m assuming you meant 5 months ago though lol.  Thank you for the walk through!"
0yp6ygN3m3o,How did u purchase the screen 5 years ago this phone didn't even exist 5 years ago
0yp6ygN3m3o,Thank you! Your video saved me over $100. Cheers!
0yp6ygN3m3o,Where do you  buy new screen at
0yp6ygN3m3o,"damn, this bro buying parts for a phone 5 years before it came out"

0yp6ygN3m3o,Thank you!
0yp6ygN3m3o,"I wonder if you are still here.... I bought the screen from Ali express and yes it also marked Service Pack.. but the quality is so faded and slow and not super sensitive.
Can you tell me where can I get the original screen please and if it is Amoled or just regular LCD"
0yp6ygN3m3o,"This is not a broken glass repair, It is rather a replacement."
0yp6ygN3m3o,"Mind sharing the link for the screen you purchased, I want to get one closest to original."
0yp6ygN3m3o,Please remove the adhesive first 13:27
0yp6ygN3m3o,where can i buy the display?
0yp6ygN3m3o,Can you make another video without replacing the frame together?
0yp6ygN3m3o,For some reason I still get a black screen after replacement
0yp6ygN3m3o,"Thought it was the glass you replaced, but you just replaced the whole front end and frame."
0yp6ygN3m3o,"After replacing my screen, the touch was twitching after 3 days😢"
0yp6ygN3m3o,How much screen A 15
0yp6ygN3m3o,My phone is not powering up after breaking the screen.
0yp6ygN3m3o,So in fixed this and for some reason the ear speaker is not working I watched the video and didn't see anything bout that anybody know why??

VDwxEagh188,"I bought this phone Samsung A15  about a month ago'  and i have to say this is a great phone, its fast has a lot or storage and a great battery, like the screen very nice and has  great sound, love the ( yellow color)  two people in my family and my friend bought this same phone this week and they really like it,  We all enjoy this phone glad we purchased it."
VDwxEagh188,"I just purchased my Samsung A15 a month ago, trying to get adjusted to it, coming from a iPhone.  I like it, love the features. very nice"
VDwxEagh188,I can't wait a little bit longer to have this galaxy A15 5g..i really admire it
VDwxEagh188,"Still here Salute. I bought this phone today at BB for memorial day and after unboxing I really like this phone. Looks solid, nice phone and love the fact that today when plugged in for first time to charge I love the fact that it shows battery life and charging time stays on."
VDwxEagh188,"That's what I'm going to buy. I don't like poco and redmi, my friend's poco x6 pro was thrown away because it turned off suddenly while playing games. Samsung legit is still good."
VDwxEagh188,Just letting people know you can boost the volume without using a sound booster. It called media volume limit. I will put up a description of f how to do it if people are unable to do it. 🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,"As phones keep getting expensive, I ended up getting this phone recently and loving it so far. The only downside was that it does not have always on display but other than that happy with my purchase."
VDwxEagh188,I ordered mone today and I know im going to love it.
VDwxEagh188,"I swapped my old Iphone 7 plus to this. I only add Php3000. 
I love it."
VDwxEagh188,I ordered the a15 5g from Straight talk last week. Picked up one for me and one for my brother for $87 for 2 since it was free with the $45 monthly plan. At that price I figured it would totally be worth it. Waiting on it to arrive on Thursday.
VDwxEagh188,Awesome review. I got this phone. I love it
VDwxEagh188,My biggest complaint is no wireless charging especially with all of the modern day technology.
VDwxEagh188,"Loving my a15 5g. Seems to be a little bit slower than my a14 5g,but not a big deal considering all that is on this phone. The size and design fits my hand so much better than the a14 5g."
VDwxEagh188,This device is kinda like the J7 or J7 prime on steroids!!!!!
VDwxEagh188,"3.5 mm Jack,Cheap,Great battery,Oled Display..Sir,take my money and give me that phone"
VDwxEagh188,im still here :) i have this phone liking it so far x
VDwxEagh188,Ur so lucky to have all those apps. Mine can’t handle all that
VDwxEagh188,This phone is great ! I bought it in September 2024 and I can say that I like it! I really like your video posts and they helped me a lot to optimize this phone. Thank you very much!
VDwxEagh188,"I""m still here when come to samsung phones i like is the software & security updates i do own one of this phone myself 😍✌️"
VDwxEagh188,I bought mine 6 months ago and now the screen has frozen and I can't use it?
VDwxEagh188,"i bought this coz of your reviews. i use this as a secondary phone to my Galaxy A34 5G.

yes i also have the February security patch. i got the 8/256GB variant. it has only the hybrid SIM tray in our country. and so far i love using my A15 5G. it has no problems. everything is very good for the price. i have no problems with it."
VDwxEagh188,"Hey what stand are you using to film the phone? It looks cool! Send a link please, super interested!"
VDwxEagh188,"I agree with below comments - very happy with this phone. Admittedly I only do very basic stuff, but it works fast, effectively. I was lucky - got mine for £123.99 and a friend set it up for me. I dont use ""stuff"", so out of that window. But its works fine. Oddly I get no signal in a local supermarket where everyone else does... must be a frequency thing... other than that - fine."
VDwxEagh188,"I love this phone as I bought it thinking it had three Card Slots like the Samsung A10 and Samsung A05S. But unfortunately not. So I have bought the Samsung AO5s and have decided to use the Samsung A15 4G as a Street Photography editing tablet with a Samsung  512 GB SD Card inside.

I must admit both the Samsung A24 4G  and Samsung A25 5G 256GB are also on my to purchase list.
The Samsung A15 5G with 256GB is also on my list and perhaps the Samsung A16 5G depending on what they so with it"
VDwxEagh188,"planning to have a15 this month, is it dual sim?"
VDwxEagh188,Excellent comprehensive review.
VDwxEagh188,I’m still here
VDwxEagh188,Its a great phone
VDwxEagh188,Great review bro got a question for you does this have Smart view for screen mirroring to the tv 🤔
VDwxEagh188,"I recently saw one of these Samsung A15 5g phones in my local Walmart and I was impressed with this screen quality and the build too.  How would you say performance in regards to multitasking holds up?  Also, do those matte screen protectors make a difference with the phone out in direct sunlight?  I enjoy content on the budget devices to see what they’re capable of, keep up the great content!"
VDwxEagh188,Is this phone better than the A52s 5G?
VDwxEagh188,Im using it as my daily phone its great
VDwxEagh188,Planned obsolescence just like that every other phone without a user replaceable battery.
VDwxEagh188,"You just earned yourself a new subscriber.

I love your honest review.

Can this Phone do Front and Back video recording at same time?"
VDwxEagh188,"Do you have the 4G version to compare with? And do these thing reload backgrounded apps a lot?
My lg with 8gb started refreshing apps sent to background as the updates came along. It sucks."
VDwxEagh188,"Is fast and also  use it as a music bank,and photo bank."
VDwxEagh188,I have the phone and seems like it's a decent phone. On Wifi it's like smooth butter but on the 5g network data it's so damn slow and just turns and buffers most of the damn time! I called boostmobile and i seem to have good coverage but this phone is so slow. And unfortunately it's impossible to be on Wifi all the time. I really wanna throw the phone out the window!!! 🙄😬
VDwxEagh188,I purchased 2 …. I from Tracfone  for about $130.00 and one from Ebay for $65.00 both new in box . They replace the  two A 12 and are capable of of running some apps  the A12 will not ( Samsung Smartthings for one ) one phone will be getting the 256 gb SD card from the old phone for pictures videos and music it will be used as external storage .
VDwxEagh188,"Thanks for a great comprehensive review! Believe it or not I bought the Samsung J320A back when it came out, I believe that was 2016 and that is the phone I am still using, I have a mini sd card in it so glad to know I can use that card to access my data from the A15. I need to update because I'm getting messages from programs that I use that my phone can't update to their latest version. The A15 is the one I am considering. I'm wondering if I take my sim card from my J320A and put it in the A15 will I then have the same phone number and plan that I have with my A320J? I have ATT prepaid."
VDwxEagh188,"Are sure that ram plus boost it to 8gb? , i only see 4"
VDwxEagh188,i have a question i bought this phone everything is good but i am facing issue with its proximity sensor its screen do not switch off when i take the phone to ear and also when i play the voice note in whatsapp its screen don't switch off and also voice comes from loud speaker when i take to my ear
VDwxEagh188,"From 150$ to 200$ There are other better phone like cmf, m35, z9s. I this like z9s for dyanamic range in images. Cmf for like design. M35 is overall best in price segment but performance could have been better.
Suggest me some if you know better mobile."
VDwxEagh188,please show me your case name and where to buy it. Thank you!
VDwxEagh188,"I am buy this phone tomorrow, if they use the virtual ram for background processes and the physical ram is not being used for that then its already good. N1 killer on smartphones are the background apps running. If you have a LCD screen like me and going to super Amoled, then the screen is going to be God tier and it has a good camera for me coming from a Nokia G20. The Nokia G20 that I have has sometimes artifacting in the instagram and youtube shorts, can't watch 720p 60fps video without lagging and on some objects the camera does not focus. Nokia G20 is not a bad phone, it's software is not good. I don't blame the hardware, but I always blame the software."
VDwxEagh188,A15 is a AMOLED  bro not lcd
VDwxEagh188,Could you please name the case you are using again I'm unable to find it. I need that case. 😁🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,we got 8/256 variant here....
VDwxEagh188,"Sir ,how is the call quality.Is the voice clear ?"
VDwxEagh188,My only concern with this phone is camera quality... How good is the camera guys? Especially compared to the Redmi Note 13
VDwxEagh188,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
VDwxEagh188,"sir, you accidentally leaked your phone number!"
VDwxEagh188,on one ui 6.0 not 6.1 will come soon tho
VDwxEagh188,A15 or a34 who worth to buy??
VDwxEagh188,How strong its build in Bluetooth?
VDwxEagh188,But i am facing problem like its draining 2x faster than normal playing of 5 to 6 min of utube consumes exactly 1% every time any solution for this...?
VDwxEagh188,I'm overseas is it okay  for the Caribbean 🇭🇹 Halla 256 GB
VDwxEagh188,💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
VDwxEagh188,Have the blue
VDwxEagh188,The RAM you showed is just like the A14.2gig RAM expandable to 4gig
VDwxEagh188,This phone takes good pictures in the back but the selfie camera is not as crispy and detailed like the back camera is doing I just got this phone 3 days ago and I like everything about it except the selfie camera I have a Huawei p30 lite and the selfie camera is 34mp and takes really good detail pictures in the back and front and I paid 200 something for that one and I paid 200 something for the new galaxy a15 but that selfie camera is not it
VDwxEagh188,Buy OnePlus 12 awesome phone
VDwxEagh188,Boss
VDwxEagh188,wow
VDwxEagh188,"The mediatek helio g99 is ridiculously slow and  freezes compared to snapdragon both with 4gb.

Snapdragon is faster"

iso6qgCo6vI,"I'm a 73 yr old woman getting my first smartphone.  I've been feeling a little fearful and overwhelmed with the technology.  I wouldn't even know how to turn it on.  Thank you so much for a clear, easily understandable training.  I'm feeling a lot more confident about the phone arriving on Monday."
iso6qgCo6vI,Outstanding!  A non-tech-savvy family member just bought one of these phones and I have had my hands full trying to explain to him how his phone works.  This video is a perfect introduction to the A15.
iso6qgCo6vI,"I'm 75 and I just got my first cell phone. I've never subscribed to or ""Liked"" a video in my life, but this one saved my Galaxy in more ways than one."
iso6qgCo6vI,You have changed my world with this video! Thank you for clear and understandable instructions for us older folks
iso6qgCo6vI,"Very nice presentation for beginners and old farts. I'm an old fart, and these phones scare me. You made me so comfortable with my new A15 . I had an older version Galaxy J7, and only did the basics with it. I feel more at home when I pick it up now. your video gets 2 thumbs up for clarity and complete explanations for what you covered. Thanks"
iso6qgCo6vI,I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy. I am a senior citizen and this video was very informative. I thank you very much. I will be watching more of your videos.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks Wayne!  Just got this phone today - an upgrade from my Samsung A11.  It's pretty similar but your tutorial is appreciated!  Oh, I am really looking forward to you explaining how to put in a 4 digit security password!  Great stuff, Wayne!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"When it comes to cell phones, you can't find anyone more green at it.  I literally knew zip; however, your style in explaining is excellent, easy to understand, and done at a pace where learning takes place more easily.  Many kudos to you.  I look forward to the next video.  Now I feel much less frustrated in that I'm starting to get it!"
iso6qgCo6vI,I LOVED ALL OF IT. I JUST GOT THE PHONE HAVING AN LG IN THE PAST FROM 9 YEARS AGO. YOU ARE AWESOME. I COULD NOT HAVE GOT THIS INFO IN THE STORE
iso6qgCo6vI,At last-a great presentation for us older folks without silly music and clear speech.Well done!(England).
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for making this phone easy to understand, Just changed from years of Flip phones, have been afraid to make the change, Great Video."
iso6qgCo6vI,"After updating from a phone that was 7-9 years old, this was very valuable. Well presented !"
iso6qgCo6vI,"I have never had a Samsung, my mom just bought this phone and I sent her this tutorial and she can actually follow it!! You really out here helping people so much. And not being condescending or making people feel stupid. Thank You😃"
iso6qgCo6vI,I have been waiting for such type of information for a long time . I am satisfied .Very kind of you. Thanks.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you very much indeed for such a great presentation.   Very easy to understand and I can now do everything on my new A15  (at the age of 81 years!)     You are a brilliant tutor!   From Herefordshire, England."
iso6qgCo6vI,That whole thing was AWESOME!! Thank u so much.  At 88 going from Galaxy 6 to A15 I really needed lots of help.
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you very much. Brilliant video for a technophobe like me!
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for explaining this well.  Some of it is over my head, and I can only do a little at a time.  I have had this phone for about a month and was so happy when I found your video!  There’s so much I don’t know how to do.  I’ll keep listening.  I may have to play this a few times,  but am grateful you made it.  ❤

My gripe is the lady at the T-Mobile store was mean.  She made me cry and feel so stupid I just got my stuff and left.  T-Mobile, however, responded quickly and so caringly — they are not going to bill me till December because the woman was so mean, and they said they don’t tolerate that — especially being so nasty to a 25-year customer.  Good service from T-Mobile!"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you. ALL great information.  I would love to know how to change ringtones and incoming messages for my Favorite people in my contacts.
iso6qgCo6vI,Thankyou for making it nice & clear for us Oldies will be setting my A15 up tomorrow!
iso6qgCo6vI,"FINALLY!!!!!  GREAT VIDEO FOR 80 YEAR OLD LADIES!!!!  NICE AND PATIENT, NO ""SALAD LANGUAGE"".  SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS!  THIS NEW PHONE HAS BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS.  THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH.  I'LL BE LOOKING FOR MORE FROM YOU."
iso6qgCo6vI,"This video for the phone I just bought was a life saver!  Am elderly and very tech challenged!  Tried the first video by someone else and immediately turned it off.  Then I found your video.  Easy to understand and pause, as needed.  I highly recommend this video.  Liked and subscribed.  Going to watch all of your videos that pertain to my Samsung Galaxy 15.  Was seriously about to turn in and pay the restocking fee to get rid of the phone.  With your help, am going to be able to maneuver the phone and do everything I need to do!  Thank you so much!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Well done mate, good job. Thank You !!!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"2 issues I have with my A15.
the first is the size of the bubble when texting.  I've read that there is no way to enlarge this at all in the vertical mode in order to see more than 4 lines of text and edit them.  The only recommendation was to go landscape in order to get a wider bubble, which is still only 4 lines though.  Is there another way?
Next, and this could just be an issue with the app, but using the GPS which I do often, I get a text or email that I want/need to look at but the controls for the app only shrink it but it still covers up a lot of my messages even though I can move it around.  The ""home screen button"" just isn't there.  Suggestions?"
iso6qgCo6vI,"How to make a call at 24:02!  So many of these ""basic"" videos assume we already know that.  I'm 78  and this is my first cell phone of any kind.  As AT&T cut my landline off I was home alone with no way to call 911 in an emergency.  Now I can!  Thank you!"
iso6qgCo6vI,Huge thanks - after charging up my phone I was clueless how to even switch it on and thank goodness for your video - I'm at 30 mins and will continue the rest tomorrow - amazingly helpful! 😁
iso6qgCo6vI,believe it or not I wasn't swiping the phone right and had to call everyone back.  Thank you and I will watch it again.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks! Just got this phone today to replace my iPhone 6 that went a little crazy. Your video is EXACTLY what is needed for older folks that don't have their heads up their phone 24/7 need to understand and adapt quickly to the basic functions and navigation of this phone. I am off to a great start and already feel more comfortable with this Samsung than I do with any of my Apple devices,thanks to your great tutelage."

iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you.  I was going back to the shop tomorrow!!!! X
iso6qgCo6vI,"I found this very informative and I thank you for it. I noticed when you were explaining voice text you did not use any punctuation. I’m having a major problem with voice texting because the system is spelling out the characters. ,?! Are being spelled out. How do we fix this? I appreciate your response. Thanks."
iso6qgCo6vI,"Absolutely brilliant! Superb explanations and demonstrations of the buttons and their use. Easy to understand and so, so helpful Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post."

iso6qgCo6vI,"Very good information for us older generation. You are an excellent teacher, just upgraded to this phone, all sections were good, especially liked how you explained setting up different email accounts. I will try that."
iso6qgCo6vI,"Quick question.... Having a heck of a time Setting up voicemail on this, sorry new phone.... Great video and break down, appreciate your time"
iso6qgCo6vI,"I've always had a S Galaxy & the button's, ( volume, etc,etc) on the left side. It's driving me nuts that they switched  side. And always swiped down from the top, not up. Swiping from the homescreen, which should be set to easy mode for us older folks. I hope there is one Ui home. You've certainly covered in depth, which can get confusing. I just hit the button on the homescreen that is  all the apps & all your apps come up like pages in a book. This swiping up is very confusing. I don't mind turning the pages, so to speak. For older people we need things that are easy & also picking the accessibility for font, style of, magnifier for older people. Changing to dark mode. I've never been able to pick up my phone & talk. I always use speaker function. The first thing I wish I could do is get Google off my phone. I use Firefox for my browser. Google takes over everything, including my Gallery. They ruined my photos now, separating them into albums, etc,etc.
Whatever I do is stay away from Google. Of course, Google won't leave you alone. Firefox protects you, Google sells all your information. Well, now you're getting into the font size 😂.  Thank You"
iso6qgCo6vI,SO VERY HELPFUL!  THANKS!!
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you so very much for this video very informative!!!
iso6qgCo6vI,I like the way you teach and model step by step the navigation process on the phone. It was very helpful so that I can show it to my beginning cell buyers and they need to know basically the fundamentals and navigation of using a cell phone.

iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you, Wayne, for the video. Question on my a15 when I'm using an app or a game, and I get out of it just for a few min. When I  tried to return to the app or game using the 3 line bottom left button. the phone doesn't  let me return to where I  left off. The phone usually restarts the game or app I was using.

BglpS_ijMdI,"Olá,

Gostaria de relatar minha insatisfação com o Samsung Galaxy Watch6 40mm que comprei no dia 5 de março de 2024.

Nos primeiros meses, o relógio funcionou perfeitamente. No entanto, recentemente comecei a notar que o aparelho está esquentando excessivamente, ao ponto de causar queimaduras na minha pele, logo abaixo de onde fica o relógio. Além disso, a bateria do relógio está descarregando muito mais rápido do que deveria e o sistema operacional ficou bastante lento.

Comprei o aparelho há menos de seis meses, portanto acredito que ele ainda esteja na garantia. Entrei em contato com o suporte oficial da Samsung, mas infelizmente fui ignorado.

Gostaria que a Samsung resolvesse esses problemas, seja através do conserto do aparelho ou da troca por um novo que funcione corretamente, sem problemas de superaquecimento, bateria e lentidão. Agradeço a atenção e aguardo um retorno breve para a solução do meu caso."

o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you for the video. Great work as always!!!
o6yNybwt0hM,"Had an A15 5g for a little while, before having to switch back to at&t, now having a base s24. The s24 may be more premium, but i genuinely miss my old A15 5g. That thing rocked."
o6yNybwt0hM,"I just got this phone and love it so far. I literally ordered it online, added a sturdy case and had it delivered to my workplace in about 40 minutes, all for under $200 inclusing taxes and delivery fees/tips. It is a lot of bang for your buck as they say. Some of the features I like are the screen quality, fingerprint reader, micro SD card capability and the food old fashioned head phone jack."
o6yNybwt0hM,"I previously owns galaxy m31 since 2020, now i bought galaxy a15 5g new  , experience is awesome fluid, lag free, 5g network coverage is awesome, battery performance in 5g is awesome, sound is loud and clear. I'm from india, my first phone was also Samsung in 2008,"
o6yNybwt0hM,The Blue Samsung Galaxy A15 8gb of RAM with a Storage of 256gb with a Micro SD card slot 2tb ready
o6yNybwt0hM,Just got this because my trusty A51 BRICKED! Good thing I had everything backed up. I really like the fingerprint reader on the thumb instead on the screen. Got a really good armor case for it and it feel rock solid. Looking forward to a good long life with it!
o6yNybwt0hM,Great content. Thank you. I just ordered mine. I too am disgusted by $1000+ electronic leashes.
o6yNybwt0hM,This is the right phone for my 77 years old Mom ❤ and Unt 😁 thanks for the info.
o6yNybwt0hM,I purchased the Samsung A15 two weeks ago and am still learning how to use it.  So far I like it if I can remember my new phone number on it.
o6yNybwt0hM,"My new phone got stolen (s24, no insurance, yeah I know lol). Had to pull my backup phone out of retirement (iphone 8 plus, still in great condition, using it right now btw) but that left me having to buy another phone outright (I keep 2 phones). Found this phone on Amazon and should receive soon. Didn’t think “cheap” phones still existed but I’m so glad they do. I don’t need all the bells and whistles so this A15 will be just fine for my needs but its funny to think this “cheap” phone is basically what phones were 5-10 years ago lol. Amazing."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Typing on A15 from India and ohere there are 3 variant,  4gb , 6gb, 8gb ram with 128gb or 256gb rom. Bought it yesterday and working pretty well 😌"
o6yNybwt0hM,the pros were spot on the cons were very specific to your experience only thank you
o6yNybwt0hM,"Am a seventy-year-old new Galaxy A15 user. It's been less than two weeks. As a senior, there's always a learning curve on any new device. The user manual is a joke! What's the deal with a C-to-C charger cable? Luckily, I still had a C to USB charger cable from my old phone."
o6yNybwt0hM,I love the finger bio-metric button. It works like a charm.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Was at the store yesterday, couldn't help noticing the Galaxy A15 has a yellowish tint on its display, eventhough the eye comfort feature has been unchecked. Comparing it side by side with the A05, the latter didn't have the same prob."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Hmmmmm, you didn't mention, either in your pros or cons opinion, anything regarding the camera system.  I know people who do want a budget-type phone with a good camera.  I enjoy your reviews a lot and have suggested several phones to friends and family based on your videos."
o6yNybwt0hM,"#1, too heavy.  Much of what you said is Greek to me LOL.  I do agree with the charging.  I wasn't thrilled to have such a ton of apps pre loaded, but I'm an old lady & mostly just use phone, messaging and maps."
o6yNybwt0hM,My brother loves this phone so much that he just purchased another one.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Overall, this seems like a great device.  Would you say all areas of performance are really good?  Multitasking, phone calls, texting, etc.  I really wish Samsung would have put dual speakers on this phone and given it some form of protection.   Both gorllla glass and water/dust resistance.  It doesn’t have to be top of the line protection but something."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Love your videos, man! Pretty sure I'll be grabbing a couple of these for my Daughters at Christmas time!"
o6yNybwt0hM,"Thanks  for  the review ! I was  also disappointed that the A15  has  4Gb of ram in 2024. Teardrop  notch vs  punch hole  doesn't  bother me. No 25 watt charger included ?? Come on.   Like   the 4 year  OS upgrades and brighter , smaller super amoled  screen.  On the  fence  though.  Considering   Moto g power 5G. 2023..  more  ram,(6Gb)   more storage , stereo speakers Even though  it only has 1  upgrade to Android 14,  its  always  goes on sale(199.99 unlocked). I still have a  moto g Play  from 2018,lol .Samsung phones never   go on sale (unlocked) even  when  new  models  are about to come  out."
o6yNybwt0hM,How does Samsung A15 128gb compare to Moto G stylus 5g 256gb. Looking forward to your response. Thank you..
o6yNybwt0hM,"I just got the A15 and will say it is an upgrade, but not a massive upgrade. However, I am still happy with the A13."
o6yNybwt0hM,For the price it has no cons you get what you pay for
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got it for my birthday yesterday
o6yNybwt0hM,Just bought  the A15...several things I don't really like about it but so far it's ok.
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone a few days ago and it's amazing i love it 😍😍
o6yNybwt0hM,Is it better than the moto g stylus 5g 2023?
o6yNybwt0hM,In just my day to day living I have never heard anyone complain about the bezels on their phones. Except tech YouTubers. Also once you slap an OtterBox (my choice of case) on your phone you literally don't notice them anyway. As long as the viewing experience is good and the battery life is good I am very happy with this phone.
o6yNybwt0hM,The only issue I have with a15 5g is that there isn't a default screen recording. I was wondering why. Do you know?
o6yNybwt0hM,U do a great job on the phone reviews. Concise and to the point with CLEAR ENGLISH.
o6yNybwt0hM,"iam a long term samsung user.
decided to change to other due to exynos issue since iam a gamer.
decided to go with redmi pro 13+.but it became expensive.

so came back to samung again
and torn between m34 and A15.
leaning more towards A15 due to its dimenity 6100+ comared to m34 exynos 1280.
hope samsung releases more midrange with other chips"
o6yNybwt0hM,"I have the Samsung Galaxy A15 5 G, but some of the texts I receive say to tap & download, but nothing the little blue thing just keeps circling.  How can I fix this so I get to read all my text messages?"
o6yNybwt0hM,Gonna buy this maybe nextweek 😊
o6yNybwt0hM,Would this be an upgrade from an iPhone xr?
o6yNybwt0hM,"Mine has been freezing up, and at times, you can't restart it or shut it off. Coming from far more expensive phones it's fine but I don't like how thick it is and the size is too short but I knew this going in. 
I don't like the power button as it seems harder to find than most others at night.
The screen capture works, but it was far easier to find and figure out on my previous phones.

In the end I am fine with it. The freezing started after the last update, and hopefully, it will get sorted out."
o6yNybwt0hM,"As an older person who wanted just a Phone simple and simple. This phone is not simple. I came from a LG K8. Which was simple.  I only use a few apps.  PHONES should only come with a few apps and allow us to add what we want. I like using Maps apps and geocache.  Both needing a GPS sensor, triangulation and It has a crappy Sensor!!!  It can only get to within 12 meters. Vs 3 meters of my older phone. I'm So disappointed I've gone back to using my older phone."
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone yesterday switched from iphone 12 + to a15 5g but i think its 4gb so 4ram ? Im nervous but i like this phone alot .😢
o6yNybwt0hM,I just purchased this phone and its awesome..Great video
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone today and Really it's nice
o6yNybwt0hM,"My pro: Pretty decent budget phone for 2024 model of phones.
My con: It doesn't have a slot for both a SIM 2 and a microSD card.
Although they did compensate with their 125Gb of storage.

In all, it's a pretty nice phone for minimalist users."
o6yNybwt0hM,I got mine on amazon for $170 WITH 256 gigs of storage and 8 gigs of ram! New and unlocked
o6yNybwt0hM,Charging the a14 might be set to adaptive so it slow charges then hurrys up the last 20% depending on how long you leave it on the charger. Not sure if you messed with it yet.
o6yNybwt0hM,Ordered one today - will come back and let you know how it went.
o6yNybwt0hM,"I've still got my Samsung A51, and I've had it 5 years now and absolutely love it, but I know I need an upgrade, and this phone keeps calling me 😅"
o6yNybwt0hM,Looks rock solid for the price. I'd buy it. 👍
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks very much for those details ❤
o6yNybwt0hM,"Reminds me of the samsung j1, simple but got the job done"
o6yNybwt0hM,The phone is very good and the future is also great
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks for the review.
o6yNybwt0hM,90hz display on a mid range galaxy. iPhone non pro models are 60hz still and cost several hundred more dollars.
o6yNybwt0hM,Just got my A15 5G and already impressed!!
o6yNybwt0hM,How is the camera?
o6yNybwt0hM,"Thank you for the great review. It made things much more clear for me and helped me in making my decision. Even though I don't subscribe to tech channels because I'm not really into that kind of stuff, I subscribed to yours. Very much appreciated."
o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you for saying it's not waterproof. It's an important thing if you live in Ireland where it rains often. My modest Oppo a16s is waterproof and is going strong after 2 years.
o6yNybwt0hM,if i want to upgrade to this is it worth it is it cameras good or should i go flagship
o6yNybwt0hM,Why can't I find the 256gb version anywhere from american websites without it being an international version of the phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,What's the thing with the bezels - near perfect design and the bezels are not an issue at all.
o6yNybwt0hM,Is this phone good for general purpose like phone calls youtube camera and stuff...??? Shld i buy this ...
o6yNybwt0hM,My mom is wanting to get me a new phone before I leave for college I don't need much so this one seems good for my needs thanks for the detailed review!! Personally I like the teardrop cameras but that's just a matter of taste ofc.
o6yNybwt0hM,As of today I actually got this phone at Walmart for 66$ with tax included. Not a bad rig for the price as a straight talk phone
o6yNybwt0hM,I have this device and love it so much. It's doing all it promised to do
o6yNybwt0hM,"I got my A15 6gb ram 5g yesterday,  it's pretty good 👍."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Regarding the cons: wider bezels and the dimple at the top - not looking up-to-date - are the last 2 things I would consider when buying any phone. A smartphone is a tool, and not something to show off. It's kind of like worrying about having an ugly bolt in the trunk of my car.

I don't play video games - most users don't. I want performance and speed, reliability and durability. This is a backup for me, and slower than my Pixel 8, but not so much that I couldn't use it. Camera isn't as good. A screen protector and case will make it far more durable for a cost of $10 to $15 - I've used them on flagships as well, and have never broken a phone or a screen."
o6yNybwt0hM,"What storage version you have? Cause I saw in another video there is a version of 256gb storage, that is pretty damn good for the price"
o6yNybwt0hM,Bezels are Good because they prevent accidental App launches or changing screens from the home screen.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Thanks for this video, God bless brother."
o6yNybwt0hM,Hey Sir is it true that this galaxy a15 has a green line issue ???
o6yNybwt0hM,"Samsung is good, the bad thing only is the design.. Xiaomi had outsmarted Samsung when it comes to design 📢"
o6yNybwt0hM,"I was so happy to learn from the comments here that I could insert my SD card under the SIM card, but the photos on the SD card came up as distorted, although on my computer, they looked just fine. We removed & re-inserted the SIM & SD card several times, but it didn't help the distortion. Also we rebooted the phone several times. Does anyone have a suggestion for me? Loved the video!"
o6yNybwt0hM,"Helpful review, thanks.
I was looking at getting this but devices not to after this. I can pick up a better second hand phone that's  not much more expensive. Now to decide which one."
o6yNybwt0hM,"My A15 5G's screen is far too sensitive. I bump it, switch hands, etc,  it lights up, leading to opening apps by ""accident"". It's a nearly constant problem. The slow charging has only recently become a problem."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Amoled is inferior regardless of slight contrast.  I will look for my favorite ips display any day  it's more robust from breaking,  brighter in the sun, better viewing angle, more accurate color.  Thanks for reviewing"
o6yNybwt0hM,I have the same phone as you.I love it.I love it better than my a 71
o6yNybwt0hM,"As of Nov 22, 2024, Amazon has this phone at $115, 'refurbished'(Excellent condition). Just bought one and will try it with Mint mobile. Can you believe Deadpool has a phone company🤯"
o6yNybwt0hM,Is Samsung Pay compatible with this phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,great video mate
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks for testing 💋🤩
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks for the info. This phone does not have wireless charger support.
o6yNybwt0hM,Need to buy a new phone and I don't know what to choose moto edge 2023 moto g 5g pixel 7 or the Samsung A15 5g what would you suggest
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it get really hot to hold after awhile because heat was an issue in my other phone
o6yNybwt0hM,This is the best phone I've had in yrs❤❤❤
o6yNybwt0hM,Can someone tell me what to do coz I cannot watch netflix while I'm on whatsapp call?
o6yNybwt0hM,I like the texxture on the a14 like glass and my fav color for the a15. Is like the navy blue matches my a9 plus
o6yNybwt0hM,I have the A13 and really wish this one were the same size. This one feels too thick and chunky.
o6yNybwt0hM,Are motorola photos better because they have gorilla glass screen on them with a snapdragon 680
o6yNybwt0hM,"Bought this phone 2 weeks ago,absolute crap,touch screen does not respond 35%,fingerprint does not work 70%,screen keeps locking by itself,cant wait to return it,absolut,incredible crap phone"
o6yNybwt0hM,Both phones look premium equally because Samsung phones are made to look the same 😅so come on .but i get  It its advertising. Marketing. But you know i hope  this new one is as good as the A14 one.
o6yNybwt0hM,Just bought this for my son for $80 👍🏻
o6yNybwt0hM,A better glass for the screen would be really nice and 6GB of RAM at $249.00 price point.
o6yNybwt0hM,"It's still $249.99! T-Mobile just gives a little credit towards each bill. What sounded like what would be about $150 for 4 lines per month would up almost $300 since 2 phones were not the A15 and there was not an iphone trade in for the ""free"" iPhone advertised. 
My advice... READ THE FINE PRINT!"
o6yNybwt0hM,"I have the A15, but not 5G version i think. Do you know if this can be charged wirelessly?"
o6yNybwt0hM,PRO: this has better 5G band support than higher end Samsung phones!  Supports n41 and n71 5G (2.4GHz and 700MHz) -- for fast wide coverage at 5G! Nice.
o6yNybwt0hM,Any way to get rid of the freezing and lag with this phone?? Having really bad issues with this one.
o6yNybwt0hM,"I had an issue with my new A15 communicating with Android Auto on my truck. All my other phones have worked over the years, not this one. It takes forever to load and none of the touch screen features work. The map eventually loads, but does not track my progress. I have arranged for a replacement with my provider, so hoping the new one will work okay. Anyone else have an issue with Android Auto and the A15?"
o6yNybwt0hM,i have the a15.cant hook it up to my TV via hdmi to usdc cable..phone says it's charging the device.tv.device tv hdmi port is controlling usb..on phone.cant change in settings...why.anyone have issues  connecting hdmi to  usbc cable  to tv..
o6yNybwt0hM,Amazing ❤❤
o6yNybwt0hM,"Hi thanks for the info just  purchased in mauritius but it is  made in India.
 Is it OK ???
Thank"
o6yNybwt0hM,Does the A15 have always on display?
o6yNybwt0hM,So far so good. Just got this yesterday.  Still hasnt gotten that GREAT charge but it's super slow
il2QoQXkU_4,"If anyone isn't targetting for a flagship phone/high-end phone but a nice-enough phone, this one is actually a great choice as you can get 4 years of upgrading Androids. It's great to see Samsung is extending the lifespan of their budget phones."
il2QoQXkU_4,That bezel is huge😮
il2QoQXkU_4,"Thats why samsung is selling a lot, they have a nice selection to choose from."

il2QoQXkU_4,it's 6.5 inch display but rounded corners like a 5.9 inch and 6 inches
il2QoQXkU_4,"Warning! AVOID SAMSUNG. I bought a Galaxy 24 Ultra 512 GB. The phone was constantly warm, the battery life was worse than on my S23+ and the fast charging didn´t work. Very bad quality. Contacted their technical support but they we unable to help me becaure the diagnostics system didn´t work for a whole week. They told me to take the phone to a repair shop. Unbelieveble! They want to repair a couple of weeks old premium phone ?!?! My feeling is that they do not care about their customers. Feels that you´re paying for a Ferrari buy they deliver a Lada. I do NOT recomment this device, it will disappoint you. I will not buy another Samsung product. Really bad service and while the technical support can´t help it is impossible to speak to somebody responsible."
il2QoQXkU_4,Why did they place that notch screen?

il2QoQXkU_4,How much price naw?

il2QoQXkU_4,Nice phone
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine yesterday. The moment I saw it, I fell in love"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I watched it once before, and that was my reaction too! As a beginner, when the person explaining how to use this is talking that fast, it's too fast to process each thing, before he moves to the next thing, etc"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Got Two Today From My Telco
Thanks for Your help ✌️👍"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Thank you so much. I just got mine today 👍👍
MN0qF-mAAyo,Very good explanation of this device.  Thank you for doing this.  My only difficulty was it was hard for me to digest what you were saying because - in my view - you talk too fast.
MN0qF-mAAyo,I love my A15. It goes great with my AR15.
MN0qF-mAAyo,I can't understand what you're saying and you're going too fast to follow.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine today on the samsung publicity video it says use smart switch to transfer your applications from another samsung phone, my new A 15 5g didn't have it and it took over an hour to install it,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,I just bought mine. Love it
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I bought one of these yesterday but there's nothing on it. I can't believe I'm asking this, but how do I use it as a phone? I don't get that screen you got there at the beginning. No search bar, no apps under it. It's been a couple of hours since they deactivated my old phone, which was about 24 hours since I bought it. Do I need to wait? I phoned my Galaxy from my landline but it says it has not been possible to connect my call."
MN0qF-mAAyo,Merci. very helpful 🇭🇹🎀🌻🍒
MN0qF-mAAyo,Mine came without a sim card? Why? Is this typical?? Help. What do I have to get or it? I've just used cheap basic phones that were all set up and I am lost and feel stupid. Thank you so much.
MN0qF-mAAyo,Why is the speaker on the left side down below?
MN0qF-mAAyo,Thank you for this!
MN0qF-mAAyo,Pull the screen down and there's a iron to take the screen shot and u can also do it by sweeping the side of ur hand across the screen and it'll take ur screen shot that way
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Thank you so much, loved it!!"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Very great introduction.  No quick start instructions in my phone.  Thank you!!
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Helpfull, but he is talking to fast."
MN0qF-mAAyo,It’s good to have plastic on the back better than the fragile glass on other phones
MN0qF-mAAyo,i got mine today an carnt get onto the phone havnt got wifi is there a way i can get passed it
MN0qF-mAAyo,How do I get my phone to put in an actual period instead of the word. Or an actual exclamation point instead of the words exclamation point question mark see what I mean
MN0qF-mAAyo,You talk WAY too fast!! Slow down!
MN0qF-mAAyo,I would like to see if I can get separate ringtones for text and notifications.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Can we teach the voice recognition component of this phone?  For instance, I want to dictate punctuation, but I get COMMA instead of a ,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I have 'clusters' of aps in folders.  Would like to bring some of those aps to my home page, but when I hold down and try to move the icon, it doesn't work?  Any thoughts?"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"For the instructional video, you will need to speak more slowly. You are here to teach people how to use an unknown device, especially for older people and twice especially for those with English as a second language.. So, instead of 9 minutes 31 seconds, spend 15 minutes. Thank you."
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I downloaded a few apps from the Play Store, and they are showing (in the Play Store) as installed, but they don't show on my home screen or anywhere else that I can see, how do I get them to show on the screen?"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Can you show who to screenshot name of person and how to send in Samsung.
MN0qF-mAAyo,I wpuld like to know how to save memory and not clutter it up with unessessary things and how to avoid getting viruses
MN0qF-mAAyo,Do you have to set up google
MN0qF-mAAyo,Excellent presentation! Thank you!
MN0qF-mAAyo,I just got mine! Thank you for this video it was real easy to follow.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Whenever I receive a group text message I get a blue ""download"" button which if I click on it it goes nowhere. Is there a setting I need to change? 
Also- when connected via bluetooth to my car I can send and receive phone calls but my contacts list is not available. Is there a setting I need to change?"
MN0qF-mAAyo,just got my a15 🎉

MN0qF-mAAyo,I LOVE HIS VOICE
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine a month ago. Works great except I'm not getting any notifications from YouTube. I've double checked all my settings and notifications are allowed from YT, but the only one I'm getting is a daily digest notification at 7 pm Eastern time."
MN0qF-mAAyo,"for me, you speak too fast, will have to find someone else"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Very difficult to follow you as you speak way too quickly. You need to slow down so the listener can properly absorb what you have said.
MN0qF-mAAyo,The split screen also you don't know how to used it ?
MN0qF-mAAyo,just got mine today
MN0qF-mAAyo,How do I receive voicemail?

MN0qF-mAAyo,"I have A15 but it doesn't have call recording, how can i activate that"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"yeah, @1:05 pretty insane? yes you think my now and years past, they could mount camera lens in the middle!!!!!!!. still decent phone,, too smooth yet still erratic. If I can get the speaker updated. The EQ presets done come close to what the speaker outputs.  It sound just like the sound comes out a square piece of tin,,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,How too activate the earphone logo of A15?
MN0qF-mAAyo,When the Samsung Galaxy A15 ring - how do I answer the phone?
MN0qF-mAAyo,How can I use google camera on my A15
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Taken me days to sort out the camera and sound configuration after they went wrong. The phone (it’s a phone!) has too many technical features. Ok, It was bought in 2024 while my other phones are older and much easier to use."
MN0qF-mAAyo,"You’re speaking to seniors and beginners. You speak too fast, too soft and don’t articulate your words. Appreciate the intent but could improve for your audience"
MN0qF-mAAyo,I still can't find screenshot and screen recording in the phone.  How can i screenshot pls?
MN0qF-mAAyo,He seems to b in a hurry! Still confused😢
MN0qF-mAAyo,Is this one better or the galaxy a24?
MN0qF-mAAyo,I Did not find this as  basic as  I  needed.   Never having had a Samsung phone before.   Plus I found you spoke too fast.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I want a different ringtone each for calls, text, emails, WhatsApp. I can't figure out how?"
MN0qF-mAAyo,0:48
MN0qF-mAAyo,Does it support 4k (2160p) video playing on YouTube?
MN0qF-mAAyo,You went thru everything waaaay too fast.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Hello.  Where is my home and back buttons?  Aside from this, liking this phone."
MN0qF-mAAyo,IT DOESN'T LET ME MOVE MY WIGIT HELPPP
MN0qF-mAAyo,I cannot figure out how to answer an incoming call.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"You speak to fast and do not enunciate well. It's had to follow your descriptions. I had to set the closed captions and still you speak so fast, no pauses between phrases to absorb what you're saying."
MN0qF-mAAyo,A15❤
MN0qF-mAAyo,I can not figure out how to take a screen shot from this phone
MN0qF-mAAyo,Where is the screenshot

6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Hello from some viewers in Canada! I'm 50 yr old man in Victoria, BC, Canada and my friends, family, and I enjoy and even depend on your thoughtful reviews. Thanks so much for this great free service you do for us! Now we're friends too, I hope. Cheers!"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I appreciate Long Term Reviews a lot. Thanks for this!
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,You sir are a blessing's in disguise. I'm planning to buy a15 LTE in December 2024. Thank you for this review great sir❤
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,My mentor has done it again. Great video boss. The bezels aren't bad.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Awesome review! Pretty sure I'll be picking up a couple of these for my daughters at Christmas!
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"I have the 4G LTE version and even though it's not as good as the 5G version, it's still a beast of a phone. 😊 Either way it's an A15, and just like it's predecessors the A14 4G LTE and 5G, these have both proven to be Samsung's best selling phones. ❤😁"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Watching from a15 4g , it's the best with heat management and the battery is difficult to complete.  It takes 2days from 100 percent it can play toe3 in high graphics"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"I have bought the Samsung A15 4G

I am watching this review on the Samsung A15. I have the blue version.  

I like the black version of the Samsung A24. And the fact that it has three slots for two sim cards and one SD Card like the Samsung A10, Samsung A12 and Samsung A05S"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Honestly. The default settings on the pics are better than my over processed s24+. Sky and greenery colors aren't exaggerated with crazy blues and rich greens.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Thankyou for sharing ☮️ I will be getting the 4g one this weekend… looking forward to it 😋
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Ive watched this video like a thousand times
I hope to get the a15 soon❤"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I got the 4g on Saturday and i must say its been wonderful so far
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,the 5G version has gyro sensor and video stabilization which are lacking on the 4G version.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,What about the storage? Would it be okay to buy the one with 8/256 gb?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Am watching this in 2025, am a Sammy fanboy but honestly ever since A13 most entry/budget phones arent appealing anymore, Samsung gimped them in one way or another to save costs & to offload excess spare parts,
A13 had a trash processor/soc
A14 had trash processor & cheap design/cheap screen
A15 tried to update the SoC but mostly becoz OneUI 6 is too heavy for the UI but the design, screen bezels & clicky buttons still say alot, also galaxy A1x loud speakers are always tin-sounding & easily blocked with fat fingers when you hold the phone
meanwhile the competition is doing More Storage, subjectively Better design & punch-hole screens with slimmer bezels & Better stereo loudspeakers, 
overall Motorola, Vivo & Transsion(Infinix, Tecno) are winning in 2024 & we hope 2025 is a new year of innovation & competitiveness from team galaxy, fingers crossed

Overall, thanks for the indepth & honest review, keep up the dope reviews, cheers"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Whats the big difference between 4G and 5G?

Is it a big upgrade?"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Great review
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Does it have any protection?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Just got mine last week it pretty good 👍
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Watching from a a12. I can get the A15 5G free just have to buy my next phone card $50 with tax, so buy my next phone card and continue using the a12 or buy phone card and register for the free a15 5g.    I will save up and buy A35 or better later. Free is always good."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Have you received any software updates on it since purchase?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Big up bro watching from Galaxy S24 Ultra ❤
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Genuinely good review and video ❤
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Pls camon 20 pro 5G and Samsung A15 5G phone which will i buy pls. I need your advice 😊
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Please also do some Tecno and Redmi long term review
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I love my A15 5G........8.7/10.....rate
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Basically Samsung phones have signal problems where there is low signal Samsung phone does not show any signals
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"I just bought the A15 5G at Target for $75, but I haven't opened or activated it yet and can return it.  Should I keep it, or should I return it and buy the A16 5G for $150?"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Unfortunately I could only find the 4Gb model available in Canada, which I've heard the OS version stretches thin..."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Super video 👍
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Whats better, the A22 4G or the A15 4G?"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Hello, I have been using the M32 4g for two years. I would like to buy the A15 4g.. Will there be a noticeable improvement?"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Bro I love you and your videos. I am currently using the A15 5g version and I can tell you that the bezels are not really an issue. You get used to them over time .

P.S. I love your outro song"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not that much of a difference."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Does thia have call recording option?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"There is a small problem with the screen when I put a protective screen and I play with 4 must the keys lag and do not respond I changed the protective screen twice always the same problem has anyone else had this problem, thank you."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,thanks! I'll get it!
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Cool review I'm already planning on buying one to replace my laggy A02s.  Also what's the wallpaper that you used on the 5G version looks pretty nice?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Will I be able to play codm for 2 years or longer with it with smooth gameplay?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Got mine in march and the icons on top are slightly burned in
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Pls what make some Samsung not to receive call 
    I mean they fail network 😢"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I'm looking to upgrade my Motorola to this phone 😊
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I need help.I used Samsung A22 5g for almost 4 years. I became too much comfortable with it but it was stolen some months ago. Now i am confused should i buy my previous model or A15 5g.My previous phone had soo many useful features i am afraid that new models might not have those features 😔.please help.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Currently watching this video on my Samsung Galaxy A15 4G.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Valor pls review the spark 30c
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Do a comparison on the redmi note 13 pro 4g vs the 13 pro 5g
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Can you make a video about a54 5g
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Thanks!
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Any issues with charging?  I have to restart over and over to get the thing to charge
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,How do you get action photos to not be blurry? All of my children's photos are blurry bc they are never still
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Worst, most frustrating phone I've ever owned. While the hardware is OK, (except for application memory management limitations) the OS user format interface is exceptionally poor. Especially anything text related.  Keyboard format, emoji settings arbitrarily alter; forcing unwanted animations; screen capture ends up interacting with apps or just swiping screen panel; voice to text is NOT intuitive,  it arbitrarily changes to message recording rather than dictaion.
I can only run a few simple apps at a time before the system crashes apps (yes cache is regularly cleared) as though it's out of RAM.
It seems to push updates almost weekly and each time it alters settings; often adding ""features"" that botch up the format I was just getting used to. Further, each ""update"" seems to degrade performance further.
I've had this phone 3 months and regret buying/using it. If possible,  I would rate it 0."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Watching on Samsung A15 5g
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Itel RS4 and A15 which one is ok for performance and for long term use
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Isn't the A15 has 4GB of RAM not 6GB that you mentioned.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,My own hangs a lot while watching Netflix
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,i think you forgot the difference of video stabilization
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,How much is the A15 4g current price
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,5:12 4g definitely. Dont see the difference
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Do both of them have headphone jacks?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Can it compete with redmi 13c 4g and 5g
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Nice review
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,❤❤❤❤
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,HI pleasee has anyone bought the phone recently......i would like to know the price specifically  d 4G
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Pls sir redmi 14c vs tecno spark 30c

Pls sir"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Im watching this video on the A15 5G and for some reason it runs HORRIBLE.  When i try turn my phone off the bottom half of the screen turns black and the top half  goes sideways (sometimes) the input delay is like 7 seconds and it lags out when i try and open apps.  And sometimes my keyboard dissapears and i cant get i back for like half an hour. Lol

6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I should have just bought the a15 4g instead of the fucking 5g cuz I don’t see any difference

6NBH0KLLe9s,"Reserve The New Galaxy Devices (Get $50 off) ➡ https://howl.link/bti56ju9nx925
What are your thoughts on the A15 5G? Thanks for watching!"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Last week I bought 2 of these Samsung Galaxy A15 5G from Best Buy for a great price and gave one of them to my wife to replace her old phone that had a swollen battery that’s about to explode. The second one I use to put music on so when I’m riding my electric moped I can listen to music with instead of my iPhone 11 Pro Max on my handlebars. The look, the build quality and the performance of the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is amazing and now I switched to this one to use as my daily driver. My iPhone is in the top drawer for now until further notice and I’ll have to get me a much cheaper phone to use while I’m riding."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I ordered one for $152 and its crazy to think cheap phones are THIS good already. 
I'm going to use it for banking and security apps mostly so the 4-5 years of software support is a big plus to me."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I ordered mine off of HSN for $100.  It comes with tracfone service, but after I use it up I am going to by a sim card for another carrier. Honestly, I had the Samsung A13 for 2 years and loved it.  I just needed a little more storage and this phone fits my needs perfectly."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I bought a15 5g at 20k INR in navy blue 
This is good and giving good battery life and not heat when gaming but warm😢 
It's is samsung best seeling a series phone in 2023"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I Switched From An Iphone 12 , Was A Bit Skeptical At First But This Phone Is Amazing , Battery Life , Storage , Customization Options Top Notch ! Will Not Be Purchasing Apple Again !"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"In July 2024, I bought the Galaxy A15 5G from Best Buy for $220.  I like the quick charging, but I don't like how difficult it can be to take screenshots.  The Galaxy S9 was my fave."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"This is the phone that I really want for just making phone calls, googling, whatsapp'ing and nothing more. Not in a million years should I spend 1.9K for a foldable Z phone just to break after a couple years."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I wanted to get the s54 but the cricket store was out of stock so I ended up getting an a15 and I have to say I've been quite pleased with it. It's not the fastest thing on the planet but it is a MASSIVE upgrade from the galaxy a10e I've been using for the past 5 years. I'm not a fan of switching phones every year or two and this phone does everything I want much better than my old phone so I don't  feel too bad about missing out on the more souped up s54.
6NBH0KLLe9s,2:20 glad Samsung is still keeping the headphone jack on the A Series phone! But it’s completely gone from the S Series phones
6NBH0KLLe9s,Just bought one for 360$ with everything its a dope phone and the camera and videos are crazy
6NBH0KLLe9s,Just ordered one of these - will report back on experience - BUT - based on reports.... for the price... pretty sure I'll be very happy.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I find it funny that all the smartphone reviews never do a segment on how the phone does on making phone calls and how it sounds when talking to someone. Its all about playing stupid games and taking pictures and crap like that,instead of whata phone is used for, to make a phone call..."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I got this phone. It's awesome.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"The ram management example was very helpful, thank you."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Made my day to see you have OSRS ❤
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Been an apple fanboy my whole life, had every iphone up to the 14 pro max. Broke my pro max and didnt wanna spend a shit ton on a new one. Went and picked this phone up and absolutely love it. I won't be going back to apple."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Great Review. I just bought this for my 81 year old mom. She just needs something basic. It's a great price.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I'm surprised most people don't know these tips to speed up your android in 2024, but here are some ways to improve the A15 5g:

-Turn off animations via developer options, if you don't know how to Google it and follow the steps.

-Put any unused apps or rarely used apps into deep sleep mode and limit background processes in the settings menu.

-A basic thing most people overlook is regularly deleting cache on all apps and individual apps.  I'm not talking about just the cleaning tool to release memory in the settings menu.  You should tap on each app after using it and hit the app info interactive i with the circle around it then go to storage and cache then clear cache.  This is something you've always needed to do in every android phone no matter the processor or RAM to ensure the apps run well.  This is one of those common sense things that any android user should know and do but most people don't do this and it helps your device.

-If you've done the other things on this list the only other thing you can do to aid better performance is to wipe your cache partition.  Again, if you don't know how to Google it or look it up on a YouTube video.  

-One final tip is to regularly restart your phone.  This releases used memory and will help the phone to run at its peak performance.  You don't have to restart your phone every day but anywhere from once every couple days to a couple times per week is ideal.

I hope this helps anyone that experiences slow performance and you'd be surprised how doing these things helps even the most laggy phones."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I just got one,international model, brand new from Amazon, great phone!"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"6:58 ahhh i understand now. The more Gigs of RAM, the more that your phone apps DOES NOT restart! I get it now. I never really understood that but now I actually do."
6NBH0KLLe9s,This Samsung Galaxy A15 5G Because I Love It ❤
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thank you! I just got one for my DD ❤
6NBH0KLLe9s,It makes no sense they give you the charge cable but not the actual charger to hook it up with? What? Did I miss something? really?
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Ive had mine for about a week and its a great phone for the price.Its not the best phone in the world,but it might be the best phone for $200 or less.I highly recommend it if your looking for a great phone at a great price"
6NBH0KLLe9s,I switched from iphone 12 Mini and I'm really happy. Great budget device
6NBH0KLLe9s,I have the prepaid version of the samsung a15 5g and it's been an extremely good phone so far.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice it has headphone jack
6NBH0KLLe9s,3:57 According to Samsung this screen has the same tech they putted on the S23 : Vision Booster. And i love it.
6NBH0KLLe9s,The 90 Hz refresh rate can be turned on or off during the set up process but the phone warns you that if you do set it up it will drain the battery  faster
6NBH0KLLe9s,Bro you really deserve more subs
6NBH0KLLe9s,this was a really in depth review and it is very informative thank you so much:)
6NBH0KLLe9s,Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
6NBH0KLLe9s,I always love ur videos of tech smartphone reviews keep it up
6NBH0KLLe9s,I live in Germany and bought the Galaxy A55 with 128GB/8GB brand new for 330€ and for the price it is absolutely unbeatable
6NBH0KLLe9s,Excellent review!
6NBH0KLLe9s,I just got mine yesterday ♥️
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thanks for making the review.
6NBH0KLLe9s,I'm thinking about using my A15 as an iPod and Media Player. As well as a place to transfer my photos onto a portable photo device. Having an FM Tuner inside my headphone jack was a surprise and happy with it
6NBH0KLLe9s,This looks great in every area except performance. Crazy the mediatek dimensity 700 chip in the a13 and a14 5g was a more solid performing chipset. I can't help but think a more reliable snapdragon chip would've been much better.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I do find it sluggish but my biggest beef with it is it doesn't play android auto on all the vehicles I drive. It just crashes, and the screen on the vehicle is frozen or just black.
If you have any advice on why it would be appreciated 👍"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thanks alot for this great video,it really helped.I've ordered mine should get it next week."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I came to this from an s21 ultra and tbh its totally fine for the price. Just reduce bloatware processes and turn off window animations.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thank you so much for this review of the Samsung A15 5G!  My gf and I both use very outdated phones, I still use my ORIGINAL LG Aristo, how old is that, lol!!!!  But I'm finding some apps will not work with my non-upgradeable operating system (Android 7)!  My gf also lives part of the year in Ecuador, part of the year here, and she needs an updated phone too!  So I just ordered two of these on Amazon, 256gb/8gb ram, for $179 each, one for me and one for her.  Big benefit for her is it's already unlocked, and dual sim slots means she can have her EC sim in one slot, her US sim in the other slot, either one ready to use whether she's here or there!  Am I right about that?  Thanks again for, in my mind, confirming my choice of this phone!"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Can you buy and use the international model in America?
UPDATE: I bought the international version of the phone and it is working with Verizon.  I bought the international version because the US version I saw for sale was $200 with the 4GB of ram and 128GB of storage and the international version I bought was $180 with 8GB of ram and 256GB of storage."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I applaud Samsung for the Sd card and headphone jack
6NBH0KLLe9s,Hey Shane great wee video as always I have used the Samsung Galaxy A13 I thought that it was a very good phone I'am currently using the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G phone it's better than the Samsung Galaxy A13 phone but I'am thinking about getting the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G some time real soon.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Unless you can get your hands on the international 8gb of ram, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE so many issues after a few months of use. I understand it's cheap but for 200 dollars I did not expect an unusable phone"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Using the Samsung A15 along side my iPhone XS and I am content 😊
6NBH0KLLe9s,Awesome Video Thanks For This Video Bro.
6NBH0KLLe9s,S24 ULTRA 3 months review please we need that 🙏
6NBH0KLLe9s,samsung galaxy a15 లో .sachivalayam employee కి అవసరం అయ్యి. ఎటెండెన్స్ కి సంబందించిన. ఆధార్ ఫేస్ అప్  instal అవ్వడం లేదు .ఇ అప్ ఇన్స్టాల్ అవ్వద్దు అని samsung వాళ్ళు  చెప్పారు .దీని వలనా నేను చాలా ఇబ్బంది పడుతున్నాను. దయచేసి పరిష్కరం దొరుకుతుందా
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Great review, I'm about to get one . Think it's good for the price."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Make a video about Samsung A35.. PLEASE .
6NBH0KLLe9s,"The other night the touch on my Pixel 6 started dying (it was long cracked, not sure what happened) so I drove to the store 30 mins before they closed and grabbed the 128GB/6GB/NFC/4G variant for $160 so I could still have a phone.  I'm shocked how good budget phones are now.  Sure, its marginally slower and has the occasional stutter, but really it does almost everything just as well. 

 My sole complaint is lack of stereo audio out the earpiece speaker. It seems like artificial market segmentation, because even a little bit from the earpiece speaker would be better than nothing."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Not a bad phone for the price. Btw you're really cute 😍
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I still have my Samsung Galaxy M21 from 2020, dropped it in a puddle & it's still going strong lol. So I'm all for Samsung Galaxy phones. Thank you for reassuring me that upgrading to this model is a good idea, as a lot of the updated apps aren't compatible with android system 12 software & network changing to only 5g network."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Very informative review. We are considering switching from iphones to the Samsung A15 model (Or carrier offers it). Thanks!
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I went to a phone store today to check out the 2024 Samsung Galaxy A15 5G.
I opened up six apps on the phone numerous times. I went back to the home screen and then to the close apps button. Each time I tapped on an open app it opened right up, it did not close.
I did this numerous times.
The phone that you are using must have a software issue."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Like what mkbhd said: cheap phones are getting good,good phones are not getting cheap
this a15 is an example of a cheap phone,4yrs ago the a10s was pretty good now this a15 is real good i  will buy this when its at its lowest price"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Excellent review.
6NBH0KLLe9s,That was a nice little blade you used to open the box
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thank you for covering the screen brightness - an often overlooked feature in the vast majority of phone reviews. My job has me working outside and I have to make and receive work-related calls and texts. My current phone (Moto G22) is pitiful in the sunlight, and that's at maximum full brightness. This has been very helpful."
6NBH0KLLe9s,On 7:58 where did you buy that controller from?
6NBH0KLLe9s,I am absolutely living in Haiti this phone for me is the best one
6NBH0KLLe9s,I just ordered 2 of these phones. Thanks for the review...I had an old lg aristo 3 and it died. I don't even think they make phones anymore. Well I think this should be a big upgrade compared to that. I also got one for my son who is turning 18 for his bday. He has an older galaxy so I'm hoping these phone last awhile. Looks good from your review. 😊
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Correction, there is video stabilization..."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"My a20 5g dies so quick i needed this. Just got the yellow one for 127 plus tax 137! But 4g. Cant wait, comes in next Tuesday ill update everyone.👍"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"This is 130€, where a iPhone 15 plus is 1119€, almost 10x as much. You can barely tell the difference, seriously. Both premium feel, with some shitty software and screen candy overdose messing up, except that Samsung/Google allows a bit more tweaking and sideloading and comes with a SD slot for near free storage updates and a mini-jack. I bet they roughly cost the same to manufacture, Apple can use slightly better quality components thanks to their production volume, but it is splitting hairs, so that means Apple gobbles up 800€ pure profit if you compare excl. VAT prices."
6NBH0KLLe9s,dont say youll do a real time test then make 5 edits it ruined any credibility in the test
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I like that Samsung has been passing the previous Gen specs down to the lower teir phone as I've found out thus is basically an A24, and also the A35 is basically an A54 ...."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not really major"
6NBH0KLLe9s,The video are stable are you using a stand or with your hands or how did you make them that stable ?
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I just ordered one yesterday with Google Fi with a nice $100 off discount, shipping was free and upfront charge $0 down....total cost $99."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thanks. I have the A14. I like it except for the camera at times. HSN has a 2 pack of the A15 on sale today for only $109.99
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Lmaoooo cant believe u got osrs on there. I maxed with around 840m total xp. I notice in some phones gws is laggy af, have u done it on this phone?"
6NBH0KLLe9s,How exactly do you charge it with a C to C cord?  Sorry but I'm behind the times on this stuff.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"A brand new A15 G5 6GB International on ""sale"", you can find for $179 CAD / $130 USD. Same phone every day for $199 CAD / 145 US. It's good for what you get."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice explain
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thank you . Does it have a head phone jack?
6NBH0KLLe9s,wont those camera lenses get scratched over time?? or are they immune to scratches from day to day use...?
6NBH0KLLe9s,Why no flashlight test -- brightness test and beam distance and beam shape
6NBH0KLLe9s,Still looking forward to the updated review for the fit 3
6NBH0KLLe9s,This phone is not reliable. Try to make a call get not registered to a network. Have to restart to make a call or text. The fixes posted on YT don't work.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"This has all the flagship features i need in a phone. 

Headphone jack & SD Card

May i ask if it has FM radio app on the phone? 

Btw if i am not wrong this is most selling samsung phone period! It sells in heaps in africa, india and certain parts of SEA"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice I'm going to buy one
6NBH0KLLe9s,Do you have to use the fingerprint scanner or is there a place fornpasscode?
6NBH0KLLe9s,I'm going to get this phone soon and I know this is a stupid question but does this phone have a ear piece speaker above the front camera so you can hear the person on the other end of the call?
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Anyone been using this have reliable performance? Im opting for a budget phone this year. I only will use spotify, android auto, snapseed and alarm/calling texting.
Is the alarm loud enough with the mono speaker? I will turn of animations and i dont give a blank about cameras, i ise a sony mirrorless."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Hello how long does the battery last? On the Samsung galaxy A15
6NBH0KLLe9s,Might look into the a35. Play pokemon go and monster hunter now alot and the 4GB ram in my a14 5G starting to become a problem. Music apps i try to use at the same time keeps cutting out due to the games eating up all of the available ram 🐏
6NBH0KLLe9s,the cross apps does get annoying. does the samsung fe phones do that aswell??
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Mine cost $380 wtf.  I got ripped off.  I did keep the same number and she gave me a screen protector, case and USB connector  but why was it so expensive?"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Why is the power button finger print sensor button flat vs the volume buttons.  Drives me nuts
6NBH0KLLe9s,I.own the Samsung A15 4G 128GB phone. Fir editing my travel photography on. I put a 512GB SD Card inside it.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"hello, very nice review! what controller do you use with you phone?"
6NBH0KLLe9s,What the name of the joypad acc that you use in this video to play games?
6NBH0KLLe9s,I searched everywhere for the speaker.Text speaker on my keyboard and ended up finding it at the bottom left which was something I was not used to
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Hey dudes, I just broke my A53 and this phone in my country is £6 a month for 24 months, shall I go for it??"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Why no mention that the edges are square now

B1iNXMGoj9I,Samsung A15 It has low-quality photos (Selfies) and the price-performance ratio compared to Xiaomi is incomparable... If the higher-class Samsung A52 s05g or the already 6-year-old Samsung A44 are of much better quality and still perform well....
