fFCGtAmse5c,I upgraded to this phone from my Samsung A11❤  It's so good alongside with my Tab A9 Plus!
fFCGtAmse5c,"Yes, I did purposely make this video 15 minutes long *(A15)* My A55 unboxing next week will be 55 minutes long 👀
-----
A15 5G via Amazon: https://geni.us/A15-5g
A15 4G/LTE  via Amazon: https://geni.us/A15-4G-LTE
microSD Card: https://geni.us/EVO-microSD"
fFCGtAmse5c,Apple should learn a thing or two from a under $200 phone about how to provide higher refresh rate display in their Non-pro line-up 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,"A bit late, but i guess I'll say my opinion. 

The A15 5g is most likely going to be one of Samsung's best selling smartphones, especially after all the upgrades. 

The biggest upgrade with the A15 is the display, no doubt. AMOLED is such a improvement, not just for gamers, but for everyday users alike due to much better color saturation and deeper blacks. The 90Hz also helps. 

Performance wise, the 128GB base storage option is very nice, the chipset ain't going to impress everyone, but its good enough for simple gaming and everyday browsing. 

Design wise, its nice and cool for most people. 

The only thing that turns people away from it is speakers and video, the speaker isn't great, dual speakers is great for music and the fact its capped on 30 fps 1080p video is upsetting. I mean i don't hate the fact that its resolution is 1080p, its just if your going to cap it on FHD, At least give a 60 fps option. 

For the price, its a very good value phone, and will still hold up in the future (Especially compared to the A05)"
fFCGtAmse5c,That fact that you can get a phone this good for that price is absolutely insane.
fFCGtAmse5c,The samsung galaxy a15 5g awesome phone the color is similar to the samsung galaxy s10 plus prism white and the samsung galaxy note 10 and 10+ and not bad at all
fFCGtAmse5c,6:24 How are you supposed to listen to calls without a speaker near selfie camera?
fFCGtAmse5c,This phone paired with the LG Gram Style 16 laptop is just perfect
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm getting it on April 10th only 1 months so excited
fFCGtAmse5c,"My personal phone is a samsung S24 , iv had it a while and was ready to upgrade when my work gave me a new A15, i think its a great lil phone, im actually considering getting A15 as my personal fone lol"
fFCGtAmse5c,I love the fact that you are always so honest when reviewing phones.
fFCGtAmse5c,❤ Love it. Huge improvements in memory capacity & screen over A14.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Somehow this phone's display is better than the one on my a54. My a54 has terrible viewing angles, tilting the screen ever so slightly gives the screen a green cast, and whites look weird, kind of greenish, if you squint, it's because there are tiny green and purple pixels scattered on the display. None of that was present in the a15's display, whites look actually white and more comforting to the eye, viewing angles are not as bad, i didn't see the weird scattered green and purple pixels, and yeah in general the difference was night-and-day"
fFCGtAmse5c,If I had known of this phone sooner I would have never traded my s22 to get the Z Flip 5 I would have gone with this phone
fFCGtAmse5c,I had came from the a21 to the a15 and I love the a15
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just bought 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my wife at walmart for 139.99 each!!!"
fFCGtAmse5c,there is a secondary speaker you couldn't do phone calls without it. But its not configured as stereo speakers.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Again, the fact that Samsung has an SD card here but not on their $1,000 phone is a travesty."
fFCGtAmse5c,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not really major"
fFCGtAmse5c,Im getting this soon
fFCGtAmse5c,"Those waching on 2025
⬇️"
fFCGtAmse5c,Is this phone for recording videos?
fFCGtAmse5c,"I want to buy this phone for my mom, she doesn't want a flagship phone, just a phone that will replace her old clunky galaxy A20. 😅"
fFCGtAmse5c,"A25 is leagues better. It really is the best option this year so far. Please, if you're going to buy a budget samsung phone, please save your money up for atleast an A25 5G. If your looking for hardware which is near flagship material but with a headphone jack, I'd say the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 pro is a much better and cheaper option."
fFCGtAmse5c,I would've gotten this color for my mom. But we would've had to wait till Friday to get it into best buy. (For the phone a couple days ago) We got her the dark blue. Both are still beautiful. I'll think more about color when they get better rugged clear cases as my mom needs it to protect hers more since she doesn't use screen protectors
fFCGtAmse5c,"I wonder, will Americans consider this phone above the Iphone SE? Samsung's budget phones are getting better and better."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Cracked my A13 screen. So im buying this one, hopefully i will be impressed"
fFCGtAmse5c,"just ordered this phone in light blue too, im so excited for it to come in!!! <3 im using a zte Blade A7P (2021) rn lol im finally upgrading after so long :) my phone struggles to run tiktok so i hope this phone can at least do that :) plus i love the color i got/the model design of it <33 and i can finally get CUTE  cases for the a15 lollooll"
fFCGtAmse5c,Im getting this phone next week
fFCGtAmse5c,My new mobile
fFCGtAmse5c,"Does it only take one sim?...
If yes do they have the one that takes 2 sims"
fFCGtAmse5c,are they any good
fFCGtAmse5c,Awesome Phone I am Getting This One Next Month
fFCGtAmse5c,"Im always jealous when I think about the a15. I Have the a14, literally the 1 thing im jealous about is that amoled screen, it really does make a huge difference. I miss the colors. The actual full-on black colors."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Ive come to the realization that the A1 series of phones are usually begind about 5 years on Camera quality in relation to the flagship lineup... The camera in the A15 is pretty much equal to the camera in the Galaxy S10 phones. The A0 phones are about 7 years behind. With the A05S being level with the S7 or S8 phones. The A2 are about 3 years behind, A3s are about 2-3 years behind, and the A5s are only 1-2 years behind."
fFCGtAmse5c,I AM watching on iPhone 12 mini 😅
fFCGtAmse5c,"Is a Samsung Galaxy A24 4G still a better buy than this ??? 
Btw..my Samsung A71 speaker sounds the same as this new A15 …😂."
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm still using the A12 phone still works ok not sure if i'm going to buy a new new phone yet if I am going to buy a new phone it would be Samsung A series of phones.
fFCGtAmse5c,Just bought this phone from Walmart $60. Works great!
fFCGtAmse5c,Does it have a screen recording feature?
fFCGtAmse5c,Super Super Sir👌👌👍👍👏👏👏👏👏
fFCGtAmse5c,"So the price of this phone varies a lot, it can be $100, 150, or absolutely free with new line purchase depending on carrier. Let's go based off Samsung's asking price of $200. My gripe with that is, for only $50 more, you can buy a used / refurbished A54 for around $250. 120 hz 1000nits IP67 better cameras better processor better build, only $50 more.

If you're hard pressed against used, then I guess this isn't a bad choice. But I'd still might lean towards the A25 cause it supports stereo sound, 120hz, and has Exynos chipset (Not as good as Snapdragon but not a budget cut chip)."
fFCGtAmse5c,I was offer a brand new ( unused) pixel 7 for the same Price as the A15 5g so what would be the best phone?? I have a lot of movie and tv series on the playstore lots of audiobook from audible and Watching youtube video
fFCGtAmse5c,"I've been a fan of Samsung phones, and just this week I bought the Samsung A15, in just 2 days the pink line started to show, and I'm not sure why. I hope that Samsung will take action on it, or else they will lose customers 😢"
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm watching this video on my Samsung Galaxy A15 5g
fFCGtAmse5c,"Damn, i was personally wishing you unbox and review the LTE(4G) Variant of this A15 and possibly give your take on the two the 5G and 4G as both use different SoC."
fFCGtAmse5c,Who's here after the outage
fFCGtAmse5c,I am on this phone now
fFCGtAmse5c,I have the ZFlip (2020) and I’m using it as a work phone. Should i upgrade to this one?
fFCGtAmse5c,"I had a Galaxy A02S for four years until the battery finally died, and just got one of these from Straight Talk for $60 yesterday. 

No comparison whatsoever. They've definitely been working on the A-Series since back then... If you're used to shopping around the $50 price mark for phones, this thing is incredible!"
fFCGtAmse5c,And my birthday is my birthday card
fFCGtAmse5c,these are on sale at walmart 89.99 cut down to 69.99 for the 4GB / 64GB version. I picked one up for my dad. Poor guy was using a old chinese ZTE that wont even support google anymore.
fFCGtAmse5c,Looks good. Trying to decide between the A15 5G and the Motorola G54.
fFCGtAmse5c,Samsung a15 5g is cool .
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just bought the A15 5G , $99 Walmart."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Good display, battery ,camera quality but performance is average"
fFCGtAmse5c,Yay the phone I got
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm coming from an S9+. Hope it satisfies.
fFCGtAmse5c,"it cost 268 dollars in canada, with tax and everything, close to 300 dollars canadian, equivalent to 223 USD"
fFCGtAmse5c,Do a15 have Samsung notes that is for me imported for me
fFCGtAmse5c,You won't understand the pain of using cheap things. 😢
fFCGtAmse5c,"I have the A15 4g, and is a way better Phone than the A14 4g and the A14 5g, better display, better design (more confortable than my previous A14) and the cameras are very good.  In my country (Chile) is a really good option than similar  Oppo or Vivo devices"
fFCGtAmse5c,Is 4gb ram good? Hows to peformance after months of usage?
fFCGtAmse5c,Sir can u thow some light on poor gaming experience reviews. I ve already ordered for my son at 9th grade. I am concerned he may tell me to take his advice 1st. I am a lay man in tech sense. All i thought was a latest 2024 model n i went for it.
fFCGtAmse5c,A35 5g im waiting for the lauch on march

iP0QW7WEyr0,Watching from galaxy a15 5g
iP0QW7WEyr0,One thing I noticed is; the widgets on the bottom corners of your lock screen can be changed or removed. Hold down on the lock screen and you will have the option to customize them. I removed the left one and set the right one to turn on and off my flashlight without unlocking the phone.
iP0QW7WEyr0,Good video bro but has anyone had screen delay freeze or so ...or its just bc screen protection glass?it happend to me every time i use to play a game?
iP0QW7WEyr0,RAM+ in my experience makes my A53 5G laggy so I turned it off. My biggest gripe with Samsung is Samsung keeps installing apps on my phone I can't uninstall.
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Thanks, this was super helpful"
iP0QW7WEyr0,Best phone I've ever had. Glad I purchased it
iP0QW7WEyr0,"I am quite tech savvy, but this guy is going way too fast. Just because he knows what he’s doing, doesn’t mean the rest of us do."

iP0QW7WEyr0,Split screen is the most unmentioned important thing

iP0QW7WEyr0,Thank you!!
iP0QW7WEyr0,Watching from A15 5g
iP0QW7WEyr0,What about screen record
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have been using it for 2 months. It's enough for most people.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got this phone free when changing service and went from an A53 5G to this. I know the A53 has better specs but with day to day use they seem about the same. I'll probably go back to my A53 just because the camera is better but other than that it would be hard to tell them apart. I think the fingerprint reader is better on the A15 and it has an actual headphone jack so those even things out a little.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review. This A15 5G looks identical to my A25, but I am glad I bought the latter, the extra 50 bucks price difference seems to be worth it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I switched from S21 to this phone because of the longer battery, but it ticks all of the boxes I need for a phone. No need spending much and this phone doesnt need a cover"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I bought this phone just for my curiosity and it's pretty good aside from the meh camera quality. I own a Pixel 8 Pro and honestly this phone is pretty good for those on a very strict budget.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 5G was released march 2023 herr in Phil. I bought mine march31 2023. .and I am very satisfied for the quality. My friends went crazy when I use this under the rain 🤣🤣🤣 until now nothing change, it seems like brand new when it comes to phone overl all performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Dear Samsung please get rid of this dam notch.Bring the punch hole in all of your devices.It is a humble request
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got my Galaxy phone....loving it so far...
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching with my newly purchased Galaxy A15. 
I have both an Iphone and this, but I prefer to use this 🥰"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why is the Samsung A15 4G faster than the A15 5G when I always hear that 5G connectivity phones are faster ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got mine yesterday and I really enjoy it. It's much faster than the a20 i had.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Some corrections:
The A15 5G uses a different processer than the A15 4G. Both phones have OIS, not EIS, both phones get supported for 4 years OS updates, 5 years for security, and you can change the display colours on both devices,and both phones can take 50 mp photos for more detail which they didnt do in the camera test for some reason."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The one thing that I like about this phone and Samsung phones in general is the sound quality in videos, they sound pretty nice, my S20 FE captures sounds with great quality and I couldn't be more happier. This A15 has great quality sound in video as well."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I will buy this phone end of may, from A03 to A15.
The best budget phone between A05s & A25"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently bought a Google Pixel 8 and bought an a15 for an emergency spare. The a15 does everything that the Google pixel 8 does, at least according to my needs (the camera on the Pixel 8 is better, however). I actually like the larger size of the a15, and for those who worry about the sturdiness of the case in the screen, you can get a rubberized case and screen covers for $10 or $15 total, making it hard to break. If I had to do it all over again, I would buy an a15 or an a25, and skip the pixel 8."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I gave my daughter this phone hope she likes it❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought it today as a toy for my daughter. I got it brand new for $40 from walmart. It is locked to straighttalk. But who cares I am not putting a sim in it, as it is going to be used as a gaming phone by kids."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just bought this for my son. Hope he likes it
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you much for the info.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"i got this to replace my redmi 8 pro as the battery was dying. great phone, feels solid, camera is not as good as only 30fps but that doesnt bother me. has all the bells and whisltles like NFC. cant fault it for a £100 phone ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I've had a Galaxy A51 for a few years and I recently bought a A15 5g.I like it but my heart will always be with my A51 lol
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you gsm
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was looking for a s24, and the shopkeeper handed over A15 and s24, and i was surprised both of them looked same almost and similar features except the camera  quality (which i dont use) but with an enormous price difference."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching from my A15 and I must say, it's just so good for its price"
MP-aGSJJsvk,i have this phone 6gb ram... I love it. huge performance difference compared to 4gb
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does this device allow screen recording?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The A15 5G is not slower because it's a 5G model, it's because there was a firmware and software issue. This has now been fixed by Samsung."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great phone for the price,"
MP-aGSJJsvk,is it good for gaming?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Whos here after the shortage
MP-aGSJJsvk,good job ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,The Samsung A15 5G 256GB is on my shopping list. I currently own the Samsung A15 4G 128GB. I use the Samsung A15 4G 128GB as a editing photography tool.  I intend to use both versions of the Samsung A15 phones as editing tablets on the go as I will put 512GB SD Card in both alongside my Redmi Pad SE  128GB tablet I also intend to purchase both the Samsung A25 5G 256GB and Samsung A25 4G 256GB and Redmi Pad Pro 256GB for my editing
MP-aGSJJsvk,Good job GSM ARENA
MP-aGSJJsvk,About to buy this phone.
MP-aGSJJsvk,This is my current phone. I went from the galaxy a24 fir 4 years with only 32 gigs so now having 128 gigs feels insane to me i can axtually download apps and take pictures again 🤣
MP-aGSJJsvk,"for 100 bucks it does the job, has a nice screen and is passible for a fill in phone"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Redmi note 11 pro 5 g or this? Im using redmi but i have A15 as well.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Me watching this on my new Samsung  A15
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Does this phone have a notification diode? Like, does it shine with a color when a message comes or a missed call? Thank you!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,5:51 Uncle Roger???👀😳😜

MP-aGSJJsvk,Watching this on the Samsung A15 4G
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can i use this in Philippines?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Does it receive calls and text ? 
Yes. Ok sold"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I think the officer in encounter 2 should get a C+. I agree his attitude was poor but he did ultimately treat the citizen in a civil manner.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Angie was a better presenter on this channel
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does the A15 5g really has gyroscope like it says?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Call flash 
Screenshot 
Screen recording available?"
MP-aGSJJsvk,🤔 where does the sd card go because it's not together in the sim tray
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does it have a delay when typing? Or when selecting anything on the screen
MP-aGSJJsvk,any news about A35 ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,dude is jacked af
MP-aGSJJsvk,Honet reviews about A15 please
MP-aGSJJsvk,Any eSIM? :/
MP-aGSJJsvk,Do a video on screen shot please
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 - 4g is the best price to performance value - you just have to live with holding your hand steady when taking pictures, other than that... A15s is that perfect duget phone samsung has made since a52s"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"In jndia 5g is unlimited however 4g data is limited to 1.5-3gb daily.
We need 5g device for hotspot😂😂😂😂"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can you do Samsung A15 4G vs 5G version?
MP-aGSJJsvk,So the ram is 4gb?
MP-aGSJJsvk,My dream phone 😢
MP-aGSJJsvk,Great for a work phone.
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15 in June anyone ??
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Something strange in that I've tuned off 90hz mode, actually it's been off for a while and I didn't notice....😮"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got this for $60 at walmart as a burner phone.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"If Will isn’t the reviewer, I’m not watching it! 😅❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I'm considering going mid range with my next phone, so I don't have to put up with so much bloatware."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"What is up with the 5G model being shittier than the 4G model. 
It should be the other way around, lmao"
MP-aGSJJsvk,official prize koto A15f 5g ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Explain this please. You say it's 5G  though there is NO 5G chip cradle in any phone that says its 5G???? Are we being conned??
MP-aGSJJsvk,How much Samsung Galaxy a15 5g?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Tecno is doing well. Look at the market share. They keep taking a bite from the samsung. It's not looking good for this  phone manufacturer
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The flashlight doesn't work when I'm taking pics using the back camera it's only works on the front camera, please assist"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Without a doubt, the worst phone I've ever had the displeasure of owning. Nowhere near worth its pricetag."
MP-aGSJJsvk,NEED HELP WITH ONE ANSWER.... Do I buy a Redmi note 13 pro 4g OR a Samsung galaxy a15 4g?(5g is not necessary)
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why does it not have a screen recorder😭😭😭😭😭
MP-aGSJJsvk,Watching with my a15 5g😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,Holy shit those bezels are disgusting. Even my Motorola from more than 3 years ago that costs like $20 more has way less bezels and a holepunch camera.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I love samsug phons😘
MP-aGSJJsvk,9.3.24😮
MP-aGSJJsvk,First from Cambodia
MP-aGSJJsvk,How many for the price and what we paid for this phone it's worth it it's nothing he liked it on this phone he had nothing positive to say

MP-aGSJJsvk,Faulty phone new phone after a month 8 hrs to full charge
MP-aGSJJsvk,regret buying this after my a40 screen is almost caput. this phone is like a brick. way too big. like for man hands.
MP-aGSJJsvk,This phone is trash i have it
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This phone has NO Samsung DEX, wireless or reverse wireless charging OR utilizes Samsung Knox so, for those FOUR reasons I can NEVER use an ""A"" series phone!  Instead I went with the S23FE with the Snapdragon CPU and got this with 256Gb of storage with 8Gb of Ram for $509 on Amazon last year!  A NO brainier!  I NEED all those FOUR features and will compromise for nothing less for work and home use!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,how come the 4G model could be faster and more responsive ? the chip in the 4g model is bette no ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I wonder what's going to happen go the buget phones one their numbers keep reaching on...
Teens to the 20's

Ect...since those other ones have already been done...

32EeGI4hyTc,Which is fater between the A15 & the A15 5G
32EeGI4hyTc,a15 or redmi note 12 ?
32EeGI4hyTc,"I don’t know if one ui 6 will have a core version

Maybe they will scrap the core version"
32EeGI4hyTc,But AMOLEDs are susceptible to green lines and led burns.
32EeGI4hyTc,Actually the A15 is FHD+ not HD+
32EeGI4hyTc,this is so hard?
32EeGI4hyTc,Noooo the a14 have 90hz screen

pm9CYCllfFg,Thanks so much for this information.  This is my dream phone
pm9CYCllfFg,"I'm part of the crew, salute!🫡🫡🫡🫡"
pm9CYCllfFg,Thanks for taking the time to show us all of this information.  All of it was very informative and helpful.
pm9CYCllfFg,I found this very helpful but I have a question for you. I installed a micro sd card but I can't figure out how to transfer the pictures and videos that my wife has on her phone to it. How is that done?
pm9CYCllfFg,Good job
pm9CYCllfFg,"Almost every single one of these was something new for me. And I actually changed at least 10 different things. But do you think you could make a video showing us how to change the character symbols' locations? On my keyboard, I hate that the question mark is so far away from the exclamation mark. On my old phone, it used to be right next to each other, but now they're on opposite sides of the keyboard. I know where in the settings it says to change it, but every time I try doing it, it's just really confusing, and I end up not changing anything."
pm9CYCllfFg,"Please, please, please can you help me? 1st of all I can do things however I need talking through it from start to finish, as you have brilliantly done in this video, and thanks for that. Right, how on earth do I get the phone to stop leaving (for E.G.) the 'Copied to clipboard' on the screen in the small grey box, it happens with other things also. I just can't get rid of it and it drives me mad! And another issue, how can you access the clipboard? Thanks in advance, MAH."
pm9CYCllfFg,Thinking of upgrading from a Pixel 3 to this! Looks so good for free (with xfinity)
pm9CYCllfFg,im still  here 👍
pm9CYCllfFg,I'm still here. 🔥
pm9CYCllfFg,What does the button on the left with a small hole on the top of it do?
pm9CYCllfFg,These are things that come with the phone.You figure it out on your own
pm9CYCllfFg,just the best great youtuber
pm9CYCllfFg,Just got mine a couple of days ago
pm9CYCllfFg,Im getting it soon
pm9CYCllfFg,How do you turn on voice commands in video mode?
pm9CYCllfFg,I'm A15 5g user i want to know all settings thank you.
pm9CYCllfFg,Some of these features aren't available on my A155g
pm9CYCllfFg,"U want to teach somtin n ur phone is on black dark screen, one cant even see wat u re clickin,"
pm9CYCllfFg,🙂👌💙
pm9CYCllfFg,All I want is to find my default sound for notifi action not ringtones
pm9CYCllfFg,How can you stop advertising it's taking all my storage on my phone.
pm9CYCllfFg,Still here
pm9CYCllfFg,I can't find half of these features. Why am I not seeing them. Example text to talk
pm9CYCllfFg,You're not showing and demonstrating what you are explaining. You're just saying what to click on.
pm9CYCllfFg,"Next time don't put it on dark mode when doing a video, we can't see anything honestly."
pm9CYCllfFg,The game on my phone
pm9CYCllfFg,I am still hear
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Good phone. Samsung's budget phones are becoming better. A few comments about the video. First, I'm happy you brought the speaker test sounds back. Second, you forgot about the selfie photo quality. But great review. Looking forward to that of the S24 ultra. Thanks."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I purchased one today and I am very happy. $170 out the door. Does the same thing as all the other Samsung phones, just a little slower. I love the single speaker at bottom. Very loud."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got this phone to replace my a03..a15 4g is a good phone after a month of usage. Videos, camera, social media, casual gaming are execellent no lag no heating battery is good. I love samsung compare to chinese phones."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn. Surveillance quality videos.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"i have a 52s 5g and an A15  4g....so far A15 runs as smoothly as my 52, if you dont overload it with apps, its running fast and smooth as hell..also the 128 gb storage and the 4 gb ram is tremendous for a cheap phone like that- but what is a 10/10 is its battery!!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn that blue looks hot
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Great review of Samsung a24, i mean a15"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Headphone jack and microSD in 2024? On a $120 phone? What a steal!
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I love that it has a decently modern 6nm chipset, great for battery life, but those AMOLED screens are more of a liability, shadows and more sensitive to impacts. OIS would be nice. The SD card and headphone jack are great."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from my brand new A15 im so loving it❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,just bought this right now from amazon canada for 170$ it'll be here in a few days ill let you know how it went.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Just upgraded from the A13 and the difference in quality is crazy
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Using ot right now, its a very good phone for its phone extraordinary value!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this phone. 6gb ram really makes butter smooth.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"In your opinion, will this phone be a good alternative for a travel phone? One that mostly is used to take pics, Google Maps, Translate, and to communicate through WhatsApp,Facebook, and use UBER or other transport. apps? I got my normal cell phone  but need a second one just for travel and one that be inexpensive but good enough to manage esim,pics and what we mostly use overseas while traveling."
SuIl1KRWhSc,I got the 5g version today!!
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this and don't mind it
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching  it on my a35 5g  looking  good
SuIl1KRWhSc,perfect phone to buy for your parents
SuIl1KRWhSc,Waooo... Going to get it immediately
SuIl1KRWhSc,"a24 or a15 
please advise which one is better"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Does this phone has call recording option without informing the call reciever?
SuIl1KRWhSc,It has the exact same external build as the A55?
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just ordered one of amazon like 5 mins ago
SuIl1KRWhSc,This Samsung a15 have otg and possible to connect lavallier wireless microphone  for vlogging
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks
SuIl1KRWhSc,What about the front camera?
SuIl1KRWhSc,The way I hate that notch with passion
SuIl1KRWhSc,Which phone will be a step up from this one? Without upping price very much. I need better camera than the A15.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Can it still work until 6-8 years?
SuIl1KRWhSc,is it eMMC ?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn tear drop again 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,I like way he present  phone and review
SuIl1KRWhSc,Tremenda maquina gran capacidad y incluso mas rapido que el a35
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Can you do A15 4G vs A24 4G, as well as A25 5G vs A34 5G and A15 5G vs A23 5G? The A24 and A15 are not fully identical."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Kapok beli hp samsung, S21 plus layar tiba-tiba garis hijau, tidak jatuh, tidak kena air, tidak sedang update system, ke service Center Samsung Yogyakarta kena biaya 1 juta untuk mengganti lcd padahal masih dalam masa garansi, kemudian ganti lcd baru. Tapi selang 2 bulan layar kembali bermasalah muncul garis hijau. Sekarang saya biarkan..."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Any problems or issues with it?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Does A15 support smart view?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Has google assistant also
SuIl1KRWhSc,same price as the a14 here in Italy now
SuIl1KRWhSc,"4 major os upgrade not 3
Also 5 years of security updates"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"If it doesnt support HDR, what does that mean? Looks like the picture quality is poor. Can anyone confirm this, I'm considering buying this phone. I currently use A30s, but it has developed multiple lines on the screen."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Samsung a15 is the same as the a24💀
SuIl1KRWhSc,does anyone find it troublesome how dark it is?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Surveillance camera quality 😂
SuIl1KRWhSc,Why can't they give A1* series a punch hole like the A11! The Infinity U display (teardrop notch) is soooo outdated.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Advantage of this over cheap chinese phones is  software support
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Is that the best Samsung Phone for people who ""give a f"" about smartphones? I have a Galaxy S7 and have more and more problems with Android 9 so i want a phone with Android 11 or higher.

I dont really use my smartphone (~15min a day) so buying a phone for +700€ is just a waste of money for me but i ""need"" a phone for my galaxy watch"
SuIl1KRWhSc,A 15 2024 1080 a54 2023 8k😂😂👌
SuIl1KRWhSc,Pense que era español
SuIl1KRWhSc,Battery timing not good
SuIl1KRWhSc,Tear drop notches should be banned already
SuIl1KRWhSc,Still Water Drop notch wtf Samsung 😂🖐️
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Why are y'all reviewing the 4g version of this phone?!







Sigh...."
SuIl1KRWhSc,👎🏽
SuIl1KRWhSc,my old 2012 mobile is blazing faster than this pile of shit. Samsung should remove ita logo for their best m seriously. I have never had worse mobile than this wanna be Mr expensive lookie phone. I would easily pay more for a 2015 mobile than paying 200 bucks for this shit. i couldn't even complete important bank job.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Esse celular não deve roda nem WhatsApp!!!!!!!
SuIl1KRWhSc,"dim screen no thanks 
800 nits is terrible"
SuIl1KRWhSc,%100 trash 🤣
SuIl1KRWhSc,is samsung still living in 2020? even cheaper chinese budget phones have punch hole front cameras. common sense must be lacking at samsung.
pfOUdk6PpsY,The most important thing for me is the android update policy (a15 gives u 4 major updates and a16 dives u 6 major updates). that means the a16 will take longer to become obsolete!
pfOUdk6PpsY,"Defo a15, cheaper while having same features and also 3.5mm headphone jack"
pfOUdk6PpsY,Prácticamente es lo mismo.
pfOUdk6PpsY,A16❤❤❤❤
pfOUdk6PpsY,Le A16 aura android 20 dans le futur ou rien a voir ?
pfOUdk6PpsY,Can I create a pin to unlock my phone?
pfOUdk6PpsY,Quanto está
pfOUdk6PpsY,Super duper third class product of samsung after 14 months only it's never work and need 12000 for repairing

0yp6ygN3m3o,"Thanks for the great video.🎉

0yp6ygN3m3o,Is the aftermarket screen lcd or oled ?
0yp6ygN3m3o,Thank you!
0yp6ygN3m3o,One of the screws on the middle frame won't move. What can i do with it
0yp6ygN3m3o,"I wonder if you are still here.... I bought the screen from Ali express and yes it also marked Service Pack.. but the quality is so faded and slow and not super sensitive.
Can you tell me where can I get the original screen please and if it is Amoled or just regular LCD"
0yp6ygN3m3o,I have same phone  with same problem  please  give the total cost
0yp6ygN3m3o,Can you make another video without replacing the frame together?
0yp6ygN3m3o,How much screen A 15
0yp6ygN3m3o,"This is not a broken glass repair, It is rather a replacement."
0yp6ygN3m3o,Ty so much!!!
0yp6ygN3m3o,So in fixed this and for some reason the ear speaker is not working I watched the video and didn't see anything bout that anybody know why??
0yp6ygN3m3o,My phone is not powering up after breaking the screen.
0yp6ygN3m3o,"After replacing my screen, the touch was twitching after 3 days😢"
0yp6ygN3m3o,For some reason I still get a black screen after replacement
0yp6ygN3m3o,"Bro, can i used the lcd of samsung A50 to samsung a15?"
VDwxEagh188,"That's what I'm going to buy. I don't like poco and redmi, my friend's poco x6 pro was thrown away because it turned off suddenly while playing games. Samsung legit is still good."
VDwxEagh188,"I swapped my old Iphone 7 plus to this. I only add Php3000. 
I love it."
VDwxEagh188,"Loving my a15 5g. Seems to be a little bit slower than my a14 5g,but not a big deal considering all that is on this phone. The size and design fits my hand so much better than the a14 5g."
VDwxEagh188,Excellent comprehensive review.
VDwxEagh188,My biggest complaint is no wireless charging especially with all of the modern day technology.
VDwxEagh188,"I""m still here when come to samsung phones i like is the software & security updates i do own one of this phone myself 😍✌️"
VDwxEagh188,This device is kinda like the J7 or J7 prime on steroids!!!!!
VDwxEagh188,"3.5 mm Jack,Cheap,Great battery,Oled Display..Sir,take my money and give me that phone"
VDwxEagh188,"I recently saw one of these Samsung A15 5g phones in my local Walmart and I was impressed with this screen quality and the build too.  How would you say performance in regards to multitasking holds up?  Also, do those matte screen protectors make a difference with the phone out in direct sunlight?  I enjoy content on the budget devices to see what they’re capable of, keep up the great content!"
VDwxEagh188,Its a great phone
VDwxEagh188,"You just earned yourself a new subscriber.

I love your honest review.

Can this Phone do Front and Back video recording at same time?"
VDwxEagh188,"Do you have the 4G version to compare with? And do these thing reload backgrounded apps a lot?
My lg with 8gb started refreshing apps sent to background as the updates came along. It sucks."
VDwxEagh188,I bought mine 6 months ago and now the screen has frozen and I can't use it?
VDwxEagh188,"I am buy this phone tomorrow, if they use the virtual ram for background processes and the physical ram is not being used for that then its already good. N1 killer on smartphones are the background apps running. If you have a LCD screen like me and going to super Amoled, then the screen is going to be God tier and it has a good camera for me coming from a Nokia G20. The Nokia G20 that I have has sometimes artifacting in the instagram and youtube shorts, can't watch 720p 60fps video without lagging and on some objects the camera does not focus. Nokia G20 is not a bad phone, it's software is not good. I don't blame the hardware, but I always blame the software."
VDwxEagh188,Planned obsolescence just like that every other phone without a user replaceable battery.
VDwxEagh188,please show me your case name and where to buy it. Thank you!
VDwxEagh188,Could you please name the case you are using again I'm unable to find it. I need that case. 😁🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,I'm overseas is it okay  for the Caribbean 🇭🇹 Halla 256 GB

iso6qgCo6vI,"FINALLY!!!!!  GREAT VIDEO FOR 80 YEAR OLD LADIES!!!!  NICE AND PATIENT, NO ""SALAD LANGUAGE"".  SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS!  THIS NEW PHONE HAS BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS.  THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH.  I'LL BE LOOKING FOR MORE FROM YOU."
iso6qgCo6vI,I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy. I am a senior citizen and this video was very informative. I thank you very much. I will be watching more of your videos.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so much for the video.  The section on how to add a different email was my absolute favorite, I now have my email on my phone, very pleased!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"After updating from a phone that was 7-9 years old, this was very valuable. Well presented !"
iso6qgCo6vI,"How to make a call at 24:02!  So many of these ""basic"" videos assume we already know that.  I'm 78  and this is my first cell phone of any kind.  As AT&T cut my landline off I was home alone with no way to call 911 in an emergency.  Now I can!  Thank you!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for explaining this well.  Some of it is over my head, and I can only do a little at a time.  I have had this phone for about a month and was so happy when I found your video!  There’s so much I don’t know how to do.  I’ll keep listening.  I may have to play this a few times,  but am grateful you made it.  ❤

My gripe is the lady at the T-Mobile store was mean.  She made me cry and feel so stupid I just got my stuff and left.  T-Mobile, however, responded quickly and so caringly — they are not going to bill me till December because the woman was so mean, and they said they don’t tolerate that — especially being so nasty to a 25-year customer.  Good service from T-Mobile!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"This video for the phone I just bought was a life saver!  Am elderly and very tech challenged!  Tried the first video by someone else and immediately turned it off.  Then I found your video.  Easy to understand and pause, as needed.  I highly recommend this video.  Liked and subscribed.  Going to watch all of your videos that pertain to my Samsung Galaxy 15.  Was seriously about to turn in and pay the restocking fee to get rid of the phone.  With your help, am going to be able to maneuver the phone and do everything I need to do!  Thank you so much!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"This video was well explained. Just got this phone, so I am starting from scratch, from a Flip Phone. Big difference  with so much to learn."
iso6qgCo6vI,great video can't figure out how to set up voicemail
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for providing such clear instructions!  You now have a new subscriber, one who is truly a dinosaur in the age of technology!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Mate - I'm only half way through this video.... THANK YOU!!!! Great guidance. I have friends who ""clicki de click - clack - its fixed!"" but thats not the same as learning for yourself. Thanks, fella. this video sorted out a lot of problems."
iso6qgCo6vI,Very helpful❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you.  I was going back to the shop tomorrow!!!! X
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you for helping me figure this phone out. You are a jewel.❤
iso6qgCo6vI,"Absolutely brilliant! Superb explanations and demonstrations of the buttons and their use. Easy to understand and so, so helpful Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post."
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so very much for this great video!!! I just bought this phone today and by watching you run through so many functions, I feel like I might just know what I am doing with it, even after just a few hours of owning it. YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!"
iso6qgCo6vI,I like the way you teach and model step by step the navigation process on the phone. It was very helpful so that I can show it to my beginning cell buyers and they need to know basically the fundamentals and navigation of using a cell phone.
iso6qgCo6vI,"2 issues I have with my A15.
the first is the size of the bubble when texting.  I've read that there is no way to enlarge this at all in the vertical mode in order to see more than 4 lines of text and edit them.  The only recommendation was to go landscape in order to get a wider bubble, which is still only 4 lines though.  Is there another way?
Next, and this could just be an issue with the app, but using the GPS which I do often, I get a text or email that I want/need to look at but the controls for the app only shrink it but it still covers up a lot of my messages even though I can move it around.  The ""home screen button"" just isn't there.  Suggestions?"
iso6qgCo6vI,"At last,A very big Thank you😊"
iso6qgCo6vI,Hey thanks a lot for this video. I haven’t used Android in many years and this is such a help.
iso6qgCo6vI,"I too am an old fart, ploughing through 150 pages made my head spin,but you have made it so simple ,thank you"
iso6qgCo6vI,Very well presented. thank you.
iso6qgCo6vI,Fantastic presentation; thanks so much for taking the time to post this.
iso6qgCo6vI,I liked this video! This video helped me a lot. Thanks! ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,i learned a lot of tricks with this video thanks a lot
iso6qgCo6vI,EXCELLENT tutorial. THX!
iso6qgCo6vI,Bought one a few days ago and the battery 🔋 quality is good I just installed a 256 sd card to transfer my apps and files on the card i heard about the A16 doesn't have a headset jack but you can get one online and it available at 5 below
iso6qgCo6vI,It actually worked ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,do you have a video-how to setup voicemail Samsung A15
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks so much for the help! Really appreciate it. I'm still confused about how to set up SMS Messenger as default and why I should set up that one versus the existing red text. When I press set up as default button nothing happens. Also I'd love to know how I can move over my notes from notes app from old droid to new droid  rather than manually having to type them in. If you have other resources or ever decide to do video on these topics please let me know, but really GREAT video. I also LOVE that they have captions so if there's a topic that I need to focus on I can scan right to it. Thanks for your service. 😇"
iso6qgCo6vI,Very interesting  will be watching the next one😂
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so much. I was having an anxiety attack! I would like my phone to do a better job of voice to text. Also my new phone send a second text, a duplicate of the first text?"
iso6qgCo6vI,Very well explained video love your video. I am planning to get this phone. I would like more videos on this phone on how to get wifi with the passwords. Or can I use my data if i don't have the wifi. I have no internet at home. Please respond on the video on this A15 5G Samsung Galaxy awaiting your videos
iso6qgCo6vI,Thanks...
iso6qgCo6vI,"What a super tutorial, thanks for posting. My A15 5g arrives in 2 days as my first smartphone so I want to be up and running when it arrives.

One query, you downloaded the Uber app as an example and it displayed on your second page of apps, is there a way to move it onto the first page? Also, will I be able to delete preloaded apps that don't interest me to save space?

Once again, many thanks."
iso6qgCo6vI,Camara like natural ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,"When I'm watching a video, on my A15, how do you reduce the size of video? (Smaller screen)"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thanks great video. But i dont get the three dots on bottom of home screen.
iso6qgCo6vI,Just changed from a Galaxy S7 to a Galaxy A15.  I can't figure out how to send my photos to my Yahoo email.  It does not come up as an option even thought it is installed and available on this phone.
iso6qgCo6vI,Need to learm how take smap shot on a andriod phone
iso6qgCo6vI,How to lock and unlock the apps?
iso6qgCo6vI,How to scan documents?
iso6qgCo6vI,"I realized pretty quick why this phone is $200 , no wireless charging! no power plug included?! ridiculous! But if you're on a tight budget its a decent phone."
iso6qgCo6vI,My screen doesn't look like this.   I have no home screen button when at the web browser
iso6qgCo6vI,The button the left won't show the apps I have open I hit it and nothing happens
iso6qgCo6vI,"FWIW, on my new to me A15, I have to swipe the green phone button to the right to answer it. This is a phone and they don't even tell you how to answer a call!!"
iso6qgCo6vI,no explanation on all three  buttons in back
iso6qgCo6vI,😊

o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you for the video. Great work as always!!!
o6yNybwt0hM,Great content. Thank you. I just ordered mine. I too am disgusted by $1000+ electronic leashes.
o6yNybwt0hM,I purchased the Samsung A15 two weeks ago and am still learning how to use it.  So far I like it if I can remember my new phone number on it.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Was at the store yesterday, couldn't help noticing the Galaxy A15 has a yellowish tint on its display, eventhough the eye comfort feature has been unchecked. Comparing it side by side with the A05, the latter didn't have the same prob."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Thanks  for  the review ! I was  also disappointed that the A15  has  4Gb of ram in 2024. Teardrop  notch vs  punch hole  doesn't  bother me. No 25 watt charger included ?? Come on.   Like   the 4 year  OS upgrades and brighter , smaller super amoled  screen.  On the  fence  though.  Considering   Moto g power 5G. 2023..  more  ram,(6Gb)   more storage , stereo speakers Even though  it only has 1  upgrade to Android 14,  its  always  goes on sale(199.99 unlocked). I still have a  moto g Play  from 2018,lol .Samsung phones never   go on sale (unlocked) even  when  new  models  are about to come  out."
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got it for my birthday yesterday
o6yNybwt0hM,Charging the a14 might be set to adaptive so it slow charges then hurrys up the last 20% depending on how long you leave it on the charger. Not sure if you messed with it yet.
o6yNybwt0hM,My mom is wanting to get me a new phone before I leave for college I don't need much so this one seems good for my needs thanks for the detailed review!! Personally I like the teardrop cameras but that's just a matter of taste ofc.
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone a few days ago and it's amazing i love it 😍😍
o6yNybwt0hM,"I was so happy to learn from the comments here that I could insert my SD card under the SIM card, but the photos on the SD card came up as distorted, although on my computer, they looked just fine. We removed & re-inserted the SIM & SD card several times, but it didn't help the distortion. Also we rebooted the phone several times. Does anyone have a suggestion for me? Loved the video!"
o6yNybwt0hM,The phone is very good and the future is also great
o6yNybwt0hM,Is it better than the moto g stylus 5g 2023?
o6yNybwt0hM,Need to buy a new phone and I don't know what to choose moto edge 2023 moto g 5g pixel 7 or the Samsung A15 5g what would you suggest
o6yNybwt0hM,What's the thing with the bezels - near perfect design and the bezels are not an issue at all.
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks for testing 💋🤩
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it get really hot to hold after awhile because heat was an issue in my other phone
o6yNybwt0hM,"As of Nov 22, 2024, Amazon has this phone at $115, 'refurbished'(Excellent condition). Just bought one and will try it with Mint mobile. Can you believe Deadpool has a phone company🤯"
o6yNybwt0hM,"My A15 5G's screen is far too sensitive. I bump it, switch hands, etc,  it lights up, leading to opening apps by ""accident"". It's a nearly constant problem. The slow charging has only recently become a problem."
o6yNybwt0hM,As of today I actually got this phone at Walmart for 66$ with tax included. Not a bad rig for the price as a straight talk phone
o6yNybwt0hM,Why can't I find the 256gb version anywhere from american websites without it being an international version of the phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,I’ve had mine for 2 weeks now. I need to get a different charging cable as it doesn’t charge. I’m using my cable from my a10e. Also…I can’t set my notifications to differentiate between text and other notifications. Thx for the video.
o6yNybwt0hM,There's samsung a15 on ebay that has 64gb instead of 128gb is the other upgrades the same?
o6yNybwt0hM,So far so good. Just got this yesterday.  Still hasnt gotten that GREAT charge but it's super slow
o6yNybwt0hM,6:49 not everyone looks for specs to differentiate the phones. This gen still need visuals. Ppl (must) dun read or search b4 buying.
o6yNybwt0hM,Any way to get rid of the freezing and lag with this phone?? Having really bad issues with this one.
o6yNybwt0hM,The back panel will come apart from over heating the back panel will come un glued!!!!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 3:56
o6yNybwt0hM,"Samsung is good, the bad thing only is the design.. Xiaomi had outsmarted Samsung when it comes to design 📢"
o6yNybwt0hM,I just bought this phone do you know exactly which charger I need to buy?  thanks.
o6yNybwt0hM,The teardrop camera lens area is cleaned more easily compared to a phone with a screen protector having a cutout dot.
o6yNybwt0hM,I purchased the Galaxy A15 5G same day while adding text contacts on my phone an ER message popped up requesting to enter my pin to unlock my phone. I don't know why my phone locked and where do I find my pin.
o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you so much ❤
o6yNybwt0hM,Does Live FM radio work with this phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,I don't like that I don't see in the gallery where you can select specific pictures to share either in text messages or email. Also there is no option to receive voice notifications on who's calling or texting me. I had both those features on my LG stylo 6 which I used all the time. Do you happen to know ifthose options are in the Samsung A15  5G phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,Does the A15 have fm radio?
o6yNybwt0hM,Amazing ❤❤
o6yNybwt0hM,"I love this  phone , you can't  beat it for the money."
o6yNybwt0hM,I can get that phone at Walmart for $139 (locked to AT&T though). And A14 for $69. Really great price for the phones! They are prepaid. But I can swap out my sim to these. And works fine
o6yNybwt0hM,Is the Samsung a15 5g better than the Samsung a32 5g? Im still using the A32 5g
o6yNybwt0hM,I got one yesterday for my bday didn’t use it yet tho
o6yNybwt0hM,No screen record or Samsung Dex
o6yNybwt0hM,"Hi guys! I'm looking for a new phone that can replace my Samsung Galaxy A6 but I can't find any that requests my needs. I'd like a Samsung that has a memory of 128 GB that can be expanded or just 256 GB, then it must have a jack for my earphones, a battery of 5000mAh with 25w fast recharge, the dimension around 160 x 77 x 8 mm. The glass protector isn't a must but I wouldn't mind if there was, same for water resistance. I'm not that picky for the camera, a decent one that can take pictures that aren't blurred. Budget 350/400 euros. I'm not into these kind of things so I know I'm asking a lot to all of you but I've been searching for hours without a decent result.
I hope you will understand my request and help me."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Not that ugly,May God Bless"
o6yNybwt0hM,As a year experieced using this phone already. I don't recommended buying it. Too hot+unresponsive touchscreen  and touchscreen don't work well😢. 8GB ram+bad cpu+heat it resulted in slow device.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Wish the 16gb upgrade had worked, now saddled with two 8 gb ddr3 sticks 
Windows 10 feels a bit outdated , should go for a tiny 11 
Speakers aren't great but since I cleaned the fan and adjusted the fan speed it's been so silent, barely audible"
o6yNybwt0hM,"Utter cons: no wireless charging, and not even a USB included in the new 15A package from Walmart, just a duplicate-ended short charging cord.. fortunately have a cranky old useless chromebook so using that huge charger setup.. this IS 2024, amirite?"
o6yNybwt0hM,What about the phone's speaker? I hear the speaker is bad.
o6yNybwt0hM,does A15 5G has wireless charge?  no reviews talk about it.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Only phone i have owned that does not conect to my car sterio system via usb cable,
So looking at replacing it"
o6yNybwt0hM,I'm watching this video on my Samsung Galaxy A15 5G
o6yNybwt0hM,The best pro about the phone its free and I got a glass screen protector and case for free when i activated
o6yNybwt0hM,"I upgraded from S9 (which BTW is still working but obviously no updates for security) a week ago. 

The A15 takes some getting used to and i made it all harder by not getting all my data transferred in store ( I bought online and collected it from a non phone store). Managed to transfer most of my data but not WhatsApp messages which is painful. I got a message up saying there wasn't enough storage which was ridiculous  because my S9 only had 64gb and the A15 has 128 gb.

Another problem is i managed to lock myself out of my yahoo account  2 weeks ago so had to change email addresses and I now have new email address on old phone  and no email address on new phone because I don't know how to to get in my new phone...

Anyway. Watching it charge is like watching a morbidly obese person losing weight.  But the battery is phenomenal. 100% charge lasts me 3 days. I don't do gaming etc just Internet browsing and a few apps, but still I'm impressed 

I'm annoyed by how you unlock the phone  you have to do your pin and then ""ok""which is a throwback to my old old S7.

I have a wallet style case so it's protected ok.

The prodictive text snd grammar check is annoying. I'm a English teacher and I know my punctuation!!"
o6yNybwt0hM,Did you say bc boarder control the price is what it is
o6yNybwt0hM,I find hard to do screenshots
o6yNybwt0hM,It won't sync with my 2019 Ford Ranger. Why?
o6yNybwt0hM,Watching this on A15 5g
o6yNybwt0hM,We have 6 and 8 gb of ram too
o6yNybwt0hM,"Please say 
Samsung galaxy a15 is good gaming isn't it"
o6yNybwt0hM,I'll probably be going from a13 5g to the a15 5g through metro
o6yNybwt0hM,"$69 @ Walmart for AT&T prepaid, can't beat it!"
o6yNybwt0hM,Someone connected to visible or verizon?
o6yNybwt0hM,4gig ram  is enough for those who use the phone for basic stuff.Not good for multitasking since 2gig of the ram is virtual.
o6yNybwt0hM,It also has bypass usb charging no joke
o6yNybwt0hM,Mediatek over exynos !
o6yNybwt0hM,"j'ai rendu ce model au bout de 3h00 !    pas de corbeillemessage !  clavier lettre chiffre trop petit et paramètre clavier a fuir !
quand a leur application que ont peut désactiver et qui ce réactive a votre insu, alors a fuir !  
j'ai voulu entre le code de validation pour accéder au plystore.. impossible d'avoir le clavier simple avec minuscule/majuscule. 
donc retour a l'achat."
o6yNybwt0hM,Can't seem to rotate the screen
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it break when dropped??
o6yNybwt0hM,Has network issues
o6yNybwt0hM,What about the cons of camera that's sucks
o6yNybwt0hM,There is no worse than this. I never been so frustrated wjth a phone in my life.
o6yNybwt0hM,Can't believe you people are lying about this phone beign decent to good prolly get paid for those false comments lol.this is the worse phone on the market right now in my opinion thin
o6yNybwt0hM,I paid$ 269  the 199 must be us dollars
o6yNybwt0hM,THE BAD     The Samsung A15 does NOT support dual SIM in the United States. or canada    you have to buy the  international version samsung phone witch cost more money
o6yNybwt0hM,It sucks. It moves slow and freezes a lot.
o6yNybwt0hM,💪💪💪💪💪💪
o6yNybwt0hM,M34
o6yNybwt0hM,Camera is not good😢😢😢
o6yNybwt0hM,If you like to take selfies.  Stay away from this phone.  Camera is awful.  Taking screenshots is another issue.  I'm sorry i purchased this phone.
o6yNybwt0hM,Lol 😅
o6yNybwt0hM,TRASH PHONE JUST RETURNED. Worst camera everrr
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I watched it once before, and that was my reaction too! As a beginner, when the person explaining how to use this is talking that fast, it's too fast to process each thing, before he moves to the next thing, etc"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine yesterday. The moment I saw it, I fell in love"
MN0qF-mAAyo,I love my A15. It goes great with my AR15.
MN0qF-mAAyo,Merci. very helpful 🇭🇹🎀🌻🍒
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine today on the samsung publicity video it says use smart switch to transfer your applications from another samsung phone, my new A 15 5g didn't have it and it took over an hour to install it,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Thank you for this !!
MN0qF-mAAyo,Pull the screen down and there's a iron to take the screen shot and u can also do it by sweeping the side of ur hand across the screen and it'll take ur screen shot that way
MN0qF-mAAyo,"yeah, @1:05 pretty insane? yes you think my now and years past, they could mount camera lens in the middle!!!!!!!. still decent phone,, too smooth yet still erratic. If I can get the speaker updated. The EQ presets done come close to what the speaker outputs.  It sound just like the sound comes out a square piece of tin,,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,I would like to see if I can get separate ringtones for text and notifications.
MN0qF-mAAyo,just got mine today
MN0qF-mAAyo,How do I get my phone to put in an actual period instead of the word. Or an actual exclamation point instead of the words exclamation point question mark see what I mean
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I downloaded a few apps from the Play Store, and they are showing (in the Play Store) as installed, but they don't show on my home screen or anywhere else that I can see, how do I get them to show on the screen?"
MN0qF-mAAyo,how do i add a profile photo for myself ?
MN0qF-mAAyo,I have to tape a code in to unlock my phone how can I go back to the dots ?.
MN0qF-mAAyo,How to copy files to the data folder
MN0qF-mAAyo,I LOVE HIS VOICE
MN0qF-mAAyo,A15❤
MN0qF-mAAyo,You talk WAY too fast!! Slow down!
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Taken me days to sort out the camera and sound configuration after they went wrong. The phone (it’s a phone!) has too many technical features. Ok, It was bought in 2024 while my other phones are older and much easier to use."
MN0qF-mAAyo,Does it support 4k (2160p) video playing on YouTube?
MN0qF-mAAyo,How can I use google camera on my A15
MN0qF-mAAyo,Very difficult to follow you as you speak way too quickly. You need to slow down so the listener can properly absorb what you have said.
MN0qF-mAAyo,I still can't find screenshot and screen recording in the phone.  How can i screenshot pls?
MN0qF-mAAyo,I Did not find this as  basic as  I  needed.   Never having had a Samsung phone before.   Plus I found you spoke too fast.
MN0qF-mAAyo,IT DOESN'T LET ME MOVE MY WIGIT HELPPP
MN0qF-mAAyo,"This phone don't have screen shot, why???"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Unlock device have forgot'n password
MN0qF-mAAyo,Where is the screenshot
MN0qF-mAAyo,"You speak to fast and do not enunciate well. It's had to follow your descriptions. I had to set the closed captions and still you speak so fast, no pauses between phrases to absorb what you're saying."
MN0qF-mAAyo,R u for real u r teaching us how to install sim card and how to wake up phone and the signal what did u smoke😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅

CbHmwfBD-7s,"Despues de 3 años usando un A02s, me regalaronneste teléfono y es increible 
Lo amo demasiado."
CbHmwfBD-7s,Hasta que por fin subiste el unboxing del Samsung Galaxy A15📱💛
CbHmwfBD-7s,Marcos 16:15 y les dijo id por todo el mundo y predicad el evangelio a toda criatura
CbHmwfBD-7s,Justo me compré un A15 y buscaba un review tuyo 😢
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Yo me lo compre este mes, y la verdad no tengo ninguna queja... puedo jugar cod mobile sin ningun problema, y la bateria le dura bastante.
Pd: el mio es Samsung Galaxy A15 5G"
CbHmwfBD-7s,La verdad ami me gustado el a15 lo tengo hace 3 meses recién llegado a Colombia todo lo interior me ha parecido un equipo rápido almacenamiento de 256 gb y con una memoria virtual  ram de 8 gb adicionales es lo mejor corre buen las aplicaciones es rápido en todo anuque no quiero hacer spoiker pero lo recomiendo al 100% es el mejor para todo
CbHmwfBD-7s,Hice una gran compra fue la mejor compra de mi vida lo recomiendo
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Eso de los cargadores mínimo se reflejara con otras cosas, no solo dar “gracias” por tener la “oportunidad” de comprar sus productos"
CbHmwfBD-7s,Un calidad precio que hace samsung
CbHmwfBD-7s,Hace una semana vi este unboxing y ya ahorita estoy escribiendo desde mi A15 🩵
CbHmwfBD-7s,Lo conseguí en 89 dólares en chile 😊🎉🎉🎉
CbHmwfBD-7s,Ya quiero ver el Review de ese teléfono isa échele ganas
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Yo compré mi Galaxy A 15 nuevo con caja pero aveces pienso que estos celulares supuestamente nuevos en caja y que se sigan comercializando después de un año y 3 meses después de su lanzamiento es muy extraño, aveces pienso que son celulares reacondicionados o restaurados por Samsung Galaxy celulares que Algún momento tuvieron daños o fallas de fabrica y los vuelven a restaurar para venderlos como nuevos y lo digo por qué mi Galaxy A 15 nuevo he notado que en su pantalla se nota los megapíxeles casi a simple vista sin esforzarse a detallar bien, es como si la pantalla de mi celular hubiese sido cambiada o restaurada por otra además que no tiene tanta iluminación como el Galaxy A 14. El Galaxy A 14 solo con el 50% de su iluminación o brillo ya tiene mucha iluminación en cambio en galaxy a 15 no tiene mucha iluminación al 50%, toca subirle mucho el brillo para ver la pantalla con más claridad.."
CbHmwfBD-7s,Viéndolo desde mi Samsung a15
CbHmwfBD-7s,Esperamos en review completo pronto
CbHmwfBD-7s,Yo lo acabo de comprar y me parece bueno 👍
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Saludos ISA siempre puntual a lo que necesitamos saber, éxitos !!"
CbHmwfBD-7s,Me lo acabo de comprar y está muy bien 🎉
CbHmwfBD-7s,Yo me lo compre ayer de telefono secundario  y la verdad esta muy bien
CbHmwfBD-7s,Cómo siempre Samsung  a la delantera en buenos celulares con este equipo destroza a los Motorolas de gama media 👍
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Podría pedirle a Samsung que agregue de nuevo cargador para evitarme comprarlo por separado pero la verdadera razón es que no soporto la profunda tristeza en la voz de Isa cuando dice que es muy poco contenido, estarás contento ahora Samsung que destruiste a un hombre bueno un hombre que nos regala felicidad con cada documental de tus propios celulares esa felicidad que le has arrebatado al arrebatarnos ese maldito cargador 😔

#cargadorporIsa"
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Vuelvo después de bastante tiempo. El teléfono es muy bonito, pero tristemente, Samsung nos sigue poniendo en la olla, ya que no incluye cargador. Que lástima."
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Viéndolo desde mi Samsung a 15, acá en Ecuador me valió $155 , Calidad-Precio"
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Pues si está de lujo 5 años de actualización, pero me quedo con mi Poco M5 
Excelente video!"
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Ahora si me convenció Samsung, buscaba un celular de Respaldo, pensaba en el Xiaomi 13 Note Pro, pero este tiene el procesador Mediatek G99 Ultra, y donde lo vi cuesta poco más de $11,000 pesos, y este Samsung trae el Mediatek G99 y por el precio y para lo que lo necesito me parece bien"
CbHmwfBD-7s,Yo viéndolo desde mi A15❤❤😅
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Ayer me robaron mi celular a30, ahora creo que comprare este, ya que queda justo a mi presupuestos 😢"
CbHmwfBD-7s,Yo tengo pensado comprarmelo!!!
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Genial Isa, Gran video, yo lo compre como un regalo para mí mamá por $2700 en Mercado Libre.

Es un gran teléfono para lo que cuesta, buena pantalla, lindas camara y va durar 4 años de actualizaciones, lo único que es algo molesto es que venga sin su cargador de 25w que le corresponde, de ahí en más, no hay ningún pero.

Saludos 😺"
CbHmwfBD-7s,Es una lastima q ya no incluya el cargador.
CbHmwfBD-7s,Pero aquí en Honduras lo venden con 6 GB de memoria RAM será que están mintiendo Al momento de venderlo me refiero al Samsung galaxy a15 4G
CbHmwfBD-7s,Aquí viendo con mi humilde Samsung a12😊
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Que bien, espero el review completo, estoy pensando en comprar este equipo aunque ando indeciso entre este o el Tecno Spark 20 pro que cuestan un aproximado de 660 soles peruanos, 170 dolares aproximadamente en la versión  de 8 de ram y 256 de memoria interna, lo que mas me llama la atención de este equipo  es la pantalla amoled el color de las fotos y pantalla y el soporte de actualizaciones, y en el tecno spark 20, también  las cámaras dual flash, grabación  dual de video y soporta grabación en 2k, los altavoces estéreo y otras cosas mas que no trae este Samsung, me gustaría también  que hicieras un unboxing y review a fondo del tecno spark 20 pro, aun no se por cuál  decidirme"
CbHmwfBD-7s,"lo compre y me vino mal el panel, cuando tenia el brillo bajo me salian manchas rojas oscuras en colores grises oscuros, por lo demas todo bien"
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Lo compre por 120 USD en 🇵🇾 , buen telefono para mi abuelo"
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Tengo el poco M5s y voy por este, si es buen cambio o no ??? 😅😅"
CbHmwfBD-7s,Hola amigo se le puede comprar cualquier cargadore carga rapido o es obligatorio el cargador original
CbHmwfBD-7s,Me sorprendes Samsung ❤️ para los que no tienen dinero para un teléfono mejor pero me sorprende ya no es como el a 13 o el a 14 que tuvo muchas críticas
CbHmwfBD-7s,Cuanto vale actualmente ese teléfono samsung en dólares?
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Esperaba el análisis para comprarlo pero me adelante, en cuando a su rendimiento tiene problemas no reproduce correctamente YouTube 1080p60  a velocidad 2x usando el codec vp9, lo quiero para un uso básico, pero si decepciona un poco lo de YouTube cuando hay dispositivos de hace casi 10 años no tienen ese problema por el codec de video vp9."
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Buen video, isa saca el review de a25 plisssss!!!!"
CbHmwfBD-7s,"me desanimo que venga sin cargador, me voy por el redmi note 13 solo por ese detalle"
CbHmwfBD-7s,Algo que nadie seguro sabe si lo conectas a otro teléfono como un a02s por el puerto cable tipo c se pone a cargar 😊
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Holaa, en la parte de los lados hay como un plástico, lo compre y estaba un poco levantado, eso se quita? Es como protección?"
CbHmwfBD-7s,"Hoy estaba por comprarlo.me gusta samsung por la funcionalidad. Pero ocupo cargador y que no lo traiga. 😵
