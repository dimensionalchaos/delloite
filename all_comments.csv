fFCGtAmse5c,"Thank you for this!  I'm 77rrs old and I really needed the help.  My 'digital Grans and great grans don't come up to the country often, I would be lost if I hadn't found your channel.  You earned my 'subscribe!'    I dropped my A12 and it didn't survive  but this phone is all this old man needs. 🤠"
fFCGtAmse5c,I upgraded to this phone from my Samsung A11❤  It's so good alongside with my Tab A9 Plus!
fFCGtAmse5c,The color reminds me of the Samsung Note 10+ Aura Glow. It's beautiful. The bottom speaker cutout also matches the new S24 series. Anyway great video!
fFCGtAmse5c,Apple should learn a thing or two from a under $200 phone about how to provide higher refresh rate display in their Non-pro line-up 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,That color is beautiful it's like the prism white from the s10 series.
fFCGtAmse5c,That fact that you can get a phone this good for that price is absolutely insane.
fFCGtAmse5c,"A bit late, but i guess I'll say my opinion. 

The A15 5g is most likely going to be one of Samsung's best selling smartphones, especially after all the upgrades. 

The biggest upgrade with the A15 is the display, no doubt. AMOLED is such a improvement, not just for gamers, but for everyday users alike due to much better color saturation and deeper blacks. The 90Hz also helps. 

Performance wise, the 128GB base storage option is very nice, the chipset ain't going to impress everyone, but its good enough for simple gaming and everyday browsing. 

Design wise, its nice and cool for most people. 

The only thing that turns people away from it is speakers and video, the speaker isn't great, dual speakers is great for music and the fact its capped on 30 fps 1080p video is upsetting. I mean i don't hate the fact that its resolution is 1080p, its just if your going to cap it on FHD, At least give a 60 fps option. 

For the price, its a very good value phone, and will still hold up in the future (Especially compared to the A05)"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Working wireless, the budget phones were always the most exciting. Seeing people who cannot afford much get better features each year was nice to see. Especially when Samsung went from the A12 to A13. Phone went from awful to useable. A14 got better and hit 1080p, but now with more ram if you get those models these phones should hopefully be able to just work now."
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm tempted to buy this as a backup.
fFCGtAmse5c,History will be made when Samsung finally decides to put punch hole display 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,This is my phone now and im so inlove with it. ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm watching on a a15 😂😂😂
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm getting it on April 10th only 1 months so excited
fFCGtAmse5c,This phone paired with the LG Gram Style 16 laptop is just perfect
fFCGtAmse5c,Best review so far well explained without pressure ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,This is by far the best easily! And the colour i got mine is the same light blue it's got the ethereal touch
fFCGtAmse5c,Ironically I just got the Samsung galaxy a14 5g. And I love it. 😂😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
fFCGtAmse5c,"Yes, I did purposely make this video 15 minutes long *(A15)* My A55 unboxing next week will be 55 minutes long 👀

A15 4G/LTE  via Amazon: https://geni.us/A15-4G-LTE
microSD Card: https://geni.us/EVO-microSD"
fFCGtAmse5c,The samsung galaxy a15 5g awesome phone the color is similar to the samsung galaxy s10 plus prism white and the samsung galaxy note 10 and 10+ and not bad at all
fFCGtAmse5c,6:24 How are you supposed to listen to calls without a speaker near selfie camera?
fFCGtAmse5c,Play tech daily my name each. Me purchased the A15-5G. From Metro by T-Mobile. Tanks dis video iss very very helpful. I love ya Content plz keep pit up.
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just got mine yesterday, and so far I love the panel, 5g and 50mp camera. I'm more than willing to deal with the single speaker and poor video quality"
fFCGtAmse5c,I see that international version of Samsung A25 is sold cheaper and just 50 more than A15. Despite that Exynos has bad rep it is still faster than Dimensity 6100+.
fFCGtAmse5c,I love the fact that you are always so honest when reviewing phones.
fFCGtAmse5c,A 15 5 is a masterpiece from samsung ❤❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,❤ Love it. Huge improvements in memory capacity & screen over A14.
fFCGtAmse5c,"My personal phone is a samsung S24 , iv had it a while and was ready to upgrade when my work gave me a new A15, i think its a great lil phone, im actually considering getting A15 as my personal fone lol"
fFCGtAmse5c,One speaker two speakers it doesn’t matter because anyone who listens to music through the speakers on their phone should have their ears cut off
fFCGtAmse5c,"I have one. It's my first ever Samsung. It's okay. It lags but it's good for 270 CAD. The camera is descent. Annyoing things: common lag, huge bezels, U shaped notch, etc. I am switching to a Galaxy A55 soon. Overall okay. Not a very fluid phone, but the rest is okay."
fFCGtAmse5c,Finally a praise worthy review 🎉🎉
fFCGtAmse5c,"i hope for their future a16, they do the punch hole in the side like what they did to a11"
fFCGtAmse5c,If you only used your phone to watch YouTube and check emails would you buy the A15 or the A05s? Im being forced to uprage from my nokia G20 due to 3g no longer being supported.
fFCGtAmse5c,Just got my own today
fFCGtAmse5c,Oof nice phone. i’m going to get one on 2024 christmas man 🎄
fFCGtAmse5c,"Waiting for a A25 review
Idk when, But im gonna wait."
fFCGtAmse5c,I ordered mine free through my carrier. As long as I had service and a certain plan. Was looking into a new budget friendly phone.
fFCGtAmse5c,there is a secondary speaker you couldn't do phone calls without it. But its not configured as stereo speakers.
fFCGtAmse5c,YES i waited so much for u to do this video W VIDEO MAN
fFCGtAmse5c,"Somehow this phone's display is better than the one on my a54. My a54 has terrible viewing angles, tilting the screen ever so slightly gives the screen a green cast, and whites look weird, kind of greenish, if you squint, it's because there are tiny green and purple pixels scattered on the display. None of that was present in the a15's display, whites look actually white and more comforting to the eye, viewing angles are not as bad, i didn't see the weird scattered green and purple pixels, and yeah in general the difference was night-and-day"
fFCGtAmse5c,"When turn on the phone, why only showed samsung galaxy?? Why not samsung galaxy A15 5G?? 😮😮"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Again, the fact that Samsung has an SD card here but not on their $1,000 phone is a travesty."
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just bought 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my wife at walmart for 139.99 each!!!"
fFCGtAmse5c,I want to upgrade from samsung a 12 should i choose this or anathor company phone someone please reply ????
fFCGtAmse5c,"Those waching on 2025
⬇️"
fFCGtAmse5c,I’m watching this while having a Gabb phone 4 pro 😭😂
fFCGtAmse5c,If I had known of this phone sooner I would have never traded my s22 to get the Z Flip 5 I would have gone with this phone
fFCGtAmse5c,"Cracked my A13 screen. So im buying this one, hopefully i will be impressed"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Could you do a video on how to ONLY use memory card NOT have photos go into my phone, PLEASE! 😊"
fFCGtAmse5c,"I wonder, will Americans consider this phone above the Iphone SE? Samsung's budget phones are getting better and better."
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm always on the go is this phone good to watch movies? Does it have Dolby Atmos? How is the screen resolution  and does it take good pictures and videos??
fFCGtAmse5c,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not really major"
fFCGtAmse5c,is it water proof?
fFCGtAmse5c,I had came from the a21 to the a15 and I love the a15
fFCGtAmse5c,Super Super Sir👌👌👍👍👏👏👏👏👏
fFCGtAmse5c,oled always right😮
fFCGtAmse5c,"A25 is leagues better. It really is the best option this year so far. Please, if you're going to buy a budget samsung phone, please save your money up for atleast an A25 5G. If your looking for hardware which is near flagship material but with a headphone jack, I'd say the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 pro is a much better and cheaper option."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Meanwhile in Australia, it’s $341 in the Samsung Australia Amazon store, but the far superior A35 only costs $100 more"
fFCGtAmse5c,I have a new A13 and a new A15. Both are 5G phones. The A13 beats it in side by side speed tests every time.........
fFCGtAmse5c,"How about having 2019 A20, this totally feels like an update."
fFCGtAmse5c,Which storage option is best value for money?
fFCGtAmse5c,"I want to buy this phone for my mom, she doesn't want a flagship phone, just a phone that will replace her old clunky galaxy A20. 😅"
fFCGtAmse5c,I have it for some time now and while the screen is excellent the overall design is horrible. They put the power button on the side barely extruding so it's extremely hard to click it. Most of the time I need to look where is the button before clicking it. It's a shame because such a small thing is so frustrating. Can't wait to get rid of it unfortunately.
fFCGtAmse5c,Is this phone for recording videos?
fFCGtAmse5c,"Is a Samsung Galaxy A24 4G still a better buy than this ??? 
Btw..my Samsung A71 speaker sounds the same as this new A15 …😂."
fFCGtAmse5c,Price
fFCGtAmse5c,Just bought this phone from Walmart $60. Works great!
fFCGtAmse5c,"Ive come to the realization that the A1 series of phones are usually begind about 5 years on Camera quality in relation to the flagship lineup... The camera in the A15 is pretty much equal to the camera in the Galaxy S10 phones. The A0 phones are about 7 years behind. With the A05S being level with the S7 or S8 phones. The A2 are about 3 years behind, A3s are about 2-3 years behind, and the A5s are only 1-2 years behind."
fFCGtAmse5c,I would've gotten this color for my mom. But we would've had to wait till Friday to get it into best buy. (For the phone a couple days ago) We got her the dark blue. Both are still beautiful. I'll think more about color when they get better rugged clear cases as my mom needs it to protect hers more since she doesn't use screen protectors
fFCGtAmse5c,Im getting this soon
fFCGtAmse5c,"I had a Galaxy A02S for four years until the battery finally died, and just got one of these from Straight Talk for $60 yesterday. 

No comparison whatsoever. They've definitely been working on the A-Series since back then... If you're used to shopping around the $50 price mark for phones, this thing is incredible!"
fFCGtAmse5c,Im getting this phone next week
fFCGtAmse5c,Awesome Phone I am Getting This One Next Month
fFCGtAmse5c,I AM watching on iPhone 12 mini 😅
fFCGtAmse5c,"Does it only take one sim?...
If yes do they have the one that takes 2 sims"
fFCGtAmse5c,I was offer a brand new ( unused) pixel 7 for the same Price as the A15 5g so what would be the best phone?? I have a lot of movie and tv series on the playstore lots of audiobook from audible and Watching youtube video
fFCGtAmse5c,"Im always jealous when I think about the a15. I Have the a14, literally the 1 thing im jealous about is that amoled screen, it really does make a huge difference. I miss the colors. The actual full-on black colors."
fFCGtAmse5c,My new mobile
fFCGtAmse5c,are they any good
fFCGtAmse5c,Does it have a screen recording feature?
fFCGtAmse5c,I like this phone its great 😊
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm watching this video on my Samsung Galaxy A15 5g
fFCGtAmse5c,Bro battery died 5hrs charge 😢 5:05
fFCGtAmse5c,how long does the battery last
fFCGtAmse5c,Hi I bought exchanged a new phone..for a new Samsung A15.. now it was 200.euro..it had no 5g. I was told.it was 5g..can you till me is it.. the box is the same and all the packaging. Only the box has no 5g. !
fFCGtAmse5c,"just ordered this phone in light blue too, im so excited for it to come in!!! <3 im using a zte Blade A7P (2021) rn lol im finally upgrading after so long :) my phone struggles to run tiktok so i hope this phone can at least do that :) plus i love the color i got/the model design of it <33 and i can finally get CUTE  cases for the a15 lollooll"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Damn, i was personally wishing you unbox and review the LTE(4G) Variant of this A15 and possibly give your take on the two the 5G and 4G as both use different SoC."
fFCGtAmse5c,Where's adapter to charge the phone?It seems I didn't see an adapter in the video
fFCGtAmse5c,does it have adapter for charging?
fFCGtAmse5c,"I've been a fan of Samsung phones, and just this week I bought the Samsung A15, in just 2 days the pink line started to show, and I'm not sure why. I hope that Samsung will take action on it, or else they will lose customers 😢"
fFCGtAmse5c,"I don't know exactly what it is, i think the vessels but I personally think the A15 looks a lot more modern and beautiful than the A14. It's much less noticeable that you're carrying a $200 Smartphone."
fFCGtAmse5c,Do you have lock screen notification? Does the screen light up when receiving notifications?
fFCGtAmse5c,I just bought one as a second phone for use when doing delivery riding (I have a z fold 4 which doesn't fit in my phone holder due to thickness
fFCGtAmse5c,I have the ZFlip (2020) and I’m using it as a work phone. Should i upgrade to this one?
fFCGtAmse5c,these are on sale at walmart 89.99 cut down to 69.99 for the 4GB / 64GB version. I picked one up for my dad. Poor guy was using a old chinese ZTE that wont even support google anymore.
fFCGtAmse5c,"So the price of this phone varies a lot, it can be $100, 150, or absolutely free with new line purchase depending on carrier. Let's go based off Samsung's asking price of $200. My gripe with that is, for only $50 more, you can buy a used / refurbished A54 for around $250. 120 hz 1000nits IP67 better cameras better processor better build, only $50 more.

If you're hard pressed against used, then I guess this isn't a bad choice. But I'd still might lean towards the A25 cause it supports stereo sound, 120hz, and has Exynos chipset (Not as good as Snapdragon but not a budget cut chip)."
fFCGtAmse5c,Is 4gb ram good? Hows to peformance after months of usage?
fFCGtAmse5c,"I also have one,this phone is nice"
fFCGtAmse5c,Seriously does this guy even do a review of other phones like the tecno camon 20 pro 5g or some other phones 😊
fFCGtAmse5c,Looks good. Trying to decide between the A15 5G and the Motorola G54.
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm coming from an S9+. Hope it satisfies.

MP-aGSJJsvk,I just got this phone. It's a very fast equipped phone when your on the go and in a fast pace environment. Like the fingerprint unlock feature is on point. The swiping on point too
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got mine for $128 out the door from T-Mobile today. I have an iPhone 11 and the A15 5G is definitely an upgrade.
MP-aGSJJsvk,The phone to get for people who want the features that matter the most to most smartphone users without wanting to pay up to $1000 more for any of the S24 models. I'd buy it.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have been using it for 2 months. It's enough for most people.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review! I have upgraded my Samsung A12 on this because it has 5G. Man, Samsung is very durable. My A12 is still good after 3 years of use. You can never go wrong with Samsung!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got this phone free when changing service and went from an A53 5G to this. I know the A53 has better specs but with day to day use they seem about the same. I'll probably go back to my A53 just because the camera is better but other than that it would be hard to tell them apart. I think the fingerprint reader is better on the A15 and it has an actual headphone jack so those even things out a little.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Bought it yesterday and I'm in love with it perfect phone❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got it. Replacement for my overheated s21, its really good for a budget phone"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought the Galaxy A15 a few days ago and so far I like it. It's probably too early to say for sure but so far it's a pretty good phone. I bought the Samsung galaxy A20 around 3 years ago and I loved it! Until the screen pixels crapped out on me after 2 or 3 months. I paid $80 to repair the screen and the new screen crappmonths. after 6 months. I was soon mad!!! 😂😭😠 So,  I'll wait past 6 months to see how this version really works for me. 😅😊"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review. This A15 5G looks identical to my A25, but I am glad I bought the latter, the extra 50 bucks price difference seems to be worth it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I switched from S21 to this phone because of the longer battery, but it ticks all of the boxes I need for a phone. No need spending much and this phone doesnt need a cover"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I bought this phone just for my curiosity and it's pretty good aside from the meh camera quality. I own a Pixel 8 Pro and honestly this phone is pretty good for those on a very strict budget.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 5G was released march 2023 herr in Phil. I bought mine march31 2023. .and I am very satisfied for the quality. My friends went crazy when I use this under the rain 🤣🤣🤣 until now nothing change, it seems like brand new when it comes to phone overl all performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got my Galaxy phone....loving it so far...
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Galaxy A15 my dream phone 😍 cant wait to save money and buy this to play my favourite games, Pree Payyee and Pabjee Mobeel at 8k max settings 500fps wow"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was attacked and robbed recently of my S24 Ultra and Switch OLED and 1800 in cash. Needless to say, I needed to shop for a new phone but was determined to get an OLED screen. I got the A15 LTE for $199 in Canada. What an incredible phone and value. The S24 Ultra is 2 grand in Canada and this phone keeps up nicely and had Android 14 installed. 
Im grateful that Samsung has a cheaper line of phones but also that they are making them so well. 
Everything about this phone is incredible for 2 hundred bucks.
Spring for the 5G model though. I should have thrown in the extra 25. My LTE is a little slow at times."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I will buy this phone end of may, from A03 to A15.
The best budget phone between A05s & A25"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This may be wrong of me to ask here but what about Angie? Like personally, are you guys still keep in touch with her? I know she moved on to start her own channel but she hasn't posted anything in a while. Both here and on her Instagram. I'm just worried about her. So please if you guys have any news, please share. Thank you."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for this review. I had to buy one 4 days ago, when the screen of my device which i had for almost 4 years gave out. I actually really like it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got mine yesterday and I really enjoy it. It's much faster than the a20 i had.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why is the Samsung A15 4G faster than the A15 5G when I always hear that 5G connectivity phones are faster ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching with my newly purchased Galaxy A15. 
I have both an Iphone and this, but I prefer to use this 🥰"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Yay ive been waiting for this video
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The one thing that I like about this phone and Samsung phones in general is the sound quality in videos, they sound pretty nice, my S20 FE captures sounds with great quality and I couldn't be more happier. This A15 has great quality sound in video as well."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you so much Gsmarena
MP-aGSJJsvk,Dear Samsung please get rid of this dam notch.Bring the punch hole in all of your devices.It is a humble request
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15 is basically A24 in disguise
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Some corrections:
The A15 5G uses a different processer than the A15 4G. Both phones have OIS, not EIS, both phones get supported for 4 years OS updates, 5 years for security, and you can change the display colours on both devices,and both phones can take 50 mp photos for more detail which they didnt do in the camera test for some reason."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This phone impressed me! For an entry level, you can't go wrong with this!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,1:50 i dont understand some phone companies the flagships won't have headphone Jacks but their mid-range will just keep the headphone jack all together
MP-aGSJJsvk,Saw her for one second and have never been happier to get her back with me
MP-aGSJJsvk,"My wife got this phone. A couple weeks in it started to get random issues locking up due to ghost touch, making the phone unusable until she restarts it. Seems to be a common issue online.

We're outside the 2 week return period, so now we need to try and bring it in the next time the issue shows up as they won't do anything unless they see the issue, but it happens sporadically and makes even restarting the phone difficult when it happens. A replacement might have the same issue so we were hoping to return the phone and go for a different model, but they said we have to go through warranty first.

Even the technician gave us a look the second he saw we had a A15 because he knew it was trouble.

Would not recommend this phone unless you don't mind your phone becoming unusable every once in a while."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Big fan of this video visual direction 🙏
MP-aGSJJsvk,"im buying this phone soon, my dad has a phone like that and it is very great. I suggest ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got two for switching from Metro to T-mobile for free. They should be here Wed. Can't wait. My a12 is old and acting up and my daughter's A07 is definitely giving up the ghost; so prayerfully made the right choice.
MP-aGSJJsvk,My elder brother bought this for me 😊❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Getting mine on Friday ❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,I gave my daughter this phone hope she likes it❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have recently bought the Samsung AO5s and Samsung A15 4G.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Which is better to buy A15 4g or A15 5g
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got one and love it. I beat my addiction of apple
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can you watch youtube videos while browsing or using other apps?
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have a midrange a73 5g since 2022. I must say its still good and i heavily use my phone on a daily basis
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought it today as a toy for my daughter. I got it brand new for $40 from walmart. It is locked to straighttalk. But who cares I am not putting a sim in it, as it is going to be used as a gaming phone by kids."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you gsm
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just bought this for my son. Hope he likes it
MP-aGSJJsvk,The best phone ever I switched from iphone and it's hands down the best phone I ever used people paying all this money for iphones and flagship phones doesn't make sense
MP-aGSJJsvk,Your nerdy ness helped me
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you much for the info.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"i got this to replace my redmi 8 pro as the battery was dying. great phone, feels solid, camera is not as good as only 30fps but that doesnt bother me. has all the bells and whisltles like NFC. cant fault it for a £100 phone ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently bought a Google Pixel 8 and bought an a15 for an emergency spare. The a15 does everything that the Google pixel 8 does, at least according to my needs (the camera on the Pixel 8 is better, however). I actually like the larger size of the a15, and for those who worry about the sturdiness of the case in the screen, you can get a rubberized case and screen covers for $10 or $15 total, making it hard to break. If I had to do it all over again, I would buy an a15 or an a25, and skip the pixel 8."
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15 5g.Best budget phone .❤❤❤❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just bought it, nice🎉"
MP-aGSJJsvk,is it good for gaming?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Would you rather have this or iPhone 13 /13 mini?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for the review: comprehensive, succinct, and interesting."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Nice. I you bought this phone as a back up for $40 bucks✊🏼
MP-aGSJJsvk,Even my 3yr old Redmi note 9pro max doesn't lag
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching from my A15 and I must say, it's just so good for its price"
MP-aGSJJsvk,❤ this phone on it now 😍
MP-aGSJJsvk,I've had a Galaxy A51 for a few years and I recently bought a A15 5g.I like it but my heart will always be with my A51 lol
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why a35 and a55 taking soo long to be launched
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was looking for a s24, and the shopkeeper handed over A15 and s24, and i was surprised both of them looked same almost and similar features except the camera  quality (which i dont use) but with an enormous price difference."
MP-aGSJJsvk,0:45 I’m here to watch the great review on this phone I just found at $100 dollars and with all due respect I started to watch this video and I was thinking about the “uncle Roger”guy lol😜I hope you don’t get offended by my dumb comment 😮
MP-aGSJJsvk,Good job GSM ARENA
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have this phone for 1 Mos now and I love it
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I never buy  super expensive  phones, as i tend to brake them all the time i dont do anything fancy or special with it im on my 3rd phone this year i work out side i get on machines and ladders trucks  etc  and thats why i get phones just like this one, im on my day number 5 and i love it!! I paid 350bucks with  screen protector and the case  with 2 years warranty 😊SUPER"
MP-aGSJJsvk,good job ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,This is a very nice phone for the money. I like the knock on and off feature as well.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you for this review. I found it most helpful. Gale
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does this one have a screen recorder?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got one today, not upgraded since the A32 5g 3 years ago"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"To be honest I have it and I'm not really happy with it. It's extremly chunky and power button is horrible to use. I can never use it without looking, you can barelly feel it. I would not recommend it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I got this phone i like it was tottalu worth ot with my laptop and it can gp up to 2k ""1440p"" Resluton. Its totally worth it especially While play games or also video edit 2k at 60  and its Smooth and its cool. :)"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does this device allow screen recording?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Redmi note 11 pro 5 g or this? Im using redmi but i have A15 as well.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have the ZFlip (2020) and I’m using it as a work phone. Should i upgrade to this one?
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just shattered my 21ultra so i think im gumna pull the trigger on this budget phone for a while
MP-aGSJJsvk,Im getting this soon😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,Pls what is the difference between this A15 and Tecno Spark 20 pro?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Should i buy this device
MP-aGSJJsvk,i have this phone 6gb ram... I love it. huge performance difference compared to 4gb
MP-aGSJJsvk,Nice review
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Bought this today after broke My 4 year old a15. It's not spectacular, but i loved that phone, and this feels like a direct upgrade.  The main downside is the camera, but i already had a shit camera, so there's not much to complain about."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Does this phone have a notification diode? Like, does it shine with a color when a message comes or a missed call? Thank you!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,The Samsung A15 5G 256GB is on my shopping list. I currently own the Samsung A15 4G 128GB. I use the Samsung A15 4G 128GB as a editing photography tool.  I intend to use both versions of the Samsung A15 phones as editing tablets on the go as I will put 512GB SD Card in both alongside my Redmi Pad SE  128GB tablet I also intend to purchase both the Samsung A25 5G 256GB and Samsung A25 4G 256GB and Redmi Pad Pro 256GB for my editing
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The A15 5G is not slower because it's a 5G model, it's because there was a firmware and software issue. This has now been fixed by Samsung."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"bit confused as to the tone in this review compared to the 4G version, is the camera not the same? I watched it a few days ago (since thats the model I'm getting) and I remember him talking much more negatively about the camera"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great phone for the price,"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Which one is better a15 or a25?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Brought 4G of  this phone two weeks ago 160$ 6GB RAM and 128GB of ROM

PROS ARE
1 Amoled display but compared to other phones like even galaxy s8 it looks little cheap idk why. 
2 Battery is perfect it consume 10% every hour of screen time
3 One UI 6 is pretty good with no lag.
4 fingerprint scanner is very responsive and very fast i love it.

Cons 
1 No HDR support for display.

2 bulky design and applying case and screen protector make it very heavy.

3 No OIS or EIS for camera. And 50mp photos looks washed out front camera is taking good photos but looks unnatural.

4 phone back is plastic and fingerprint marks are very visible. After wiping it several times tiny scratches was visible which is not good. I applied plastic protection in the back to solve further scratches.

5 Front screen have no protection its normal glass I was very sad that it didn't have any type of glass  protection. So I applied screen protector to keep it safe."
MP-aGSJJsvk,The only thing I don't like about the A15 is it's not easy to take a screenshot....😢
MP-aGSJJsvk,Angie was a better presenter on this channel
MP-aGSJJsvk,My Vivo y91 is almost 6 years. Might get this bad boy
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got this phone.  It does the job for me but definitely get a case for it, it is very slippery."
MP-aGSJJsvk,First from Cambodia
MP-aGSJJsvk,About to buy this phone.
MP-aGSJJsvk,So it's the A14 5g with a dimensity 6100 chip set.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just want to use the phone for doing deliveries like doordash and Uber eats. Don't care about the photos.

pm9CYCllfFg,watched it and did almost every tip to my new phone as my last one fell out my hoodie into water and died.. this it my new phone and has pretty great features.. glad i searched and found ur vid.. i liked :)
pm9CYCllfFg,"I'm part of the crew, salute!🫡🫡🫡🫡"
pm9CYCllfFg,I'm still here! 😊 Great review. To me Samsung eco system is great.
pm9CYCllfFg,Thanks so much for this information.  This is my dream phone
pm9CYCllfFg,"Thank you for this very helpful vid.  I just upgraded to this from a Jitterbug (Lively) phone and you have helped me so much, being a non techy. lol  I would like to know how to get the voice to text readily available and not have to click everytime and choose it.  Thanks again!"
pm9CYCllfFg,Great information
pm9CYCllfFg,Thanks for taking the time to show us all of this information.  All of it was very informative and helpful.
pm9CYCllfFg,Is there any way to bring the screenshot icon like to the bottom of the phone? So its easier? I can't find the icon you clicked so fast 😔
pm9CYCllfFg,I found this very helpful but I have a question for you. I installed a micro sd card but I can't figure out how to transfer the pictures and videos that my wife has on her phone to it. How is that done?
pm9CYCllfFg,What a good channel man ❤
pm9CYCllfFg,"Almost every single one of these was something new for me. And I actually changed at least 10 different things. But do you think you could make a video showing us how to change the character symbols' locations? On my keyboard, I hate that the question mark is so far away from the exclamation mark. On my old phone, it used to be right next to each other, but now they're on opposite sides of the keyboard. I know where in the settings it says to change it, but every time I try doing it, it's just really confusing, and I end up not changing anything."
pm9CYCllfFg,Is there more than one way to do a screen shot. I find it very hard to do it. Thank you
pm9CYCllfFg,"Hi got this phone about 6 months ago ,but i can not get it to notify me of a voice mail . talk to straight talk they looked at there settings  said things was ok on there side . would you have any ideals what it might be ?"
pm9CYCllfFg,"Watched, but barely see the phone screen."
pm9CYCllfFg,"Mr. Butler,
Hope all is well. After watching your video on the A15, I  was  so convinced as to which phone I was going to purchase...however when I  went to the Samsung website, I basically got talked out of the A15, and into the A25. PLEASE, I need your help/opinion/advice because I am older and not very tech savvy. I have scoured YouTube looking to see if you had a video similar to this one about the A15 but giving a review of the A25. PLEASE HELP,  I need to make my decision soon. Thx in advance 😊"
pm9CYCllfFg,Good job
pm9CYCllfFg,"I just got this phone and really happy with it...question, when I'm listening to music on Spotify for example how can I pin the app so I don't accidentally close it?"
pm9CYCllfFg,"Please, please, please can you help me? 1st of all I can do things however I need talking through it from start to finish, as you have brilliantly done in this video, and thanks for that. Right, how on earth do I get the phone to stop leaving (for E.G.) the 'Copied to clipboard' on the screen in the small grey box, it happens with other things also. I just can't get rid of it and it drives me mad! And another issue, how can you access the clipboard? Thanks in advance, MAH."
pm9CYCllfFg,How do you have the microphone show on the keyboard?
pm9CYCllfFg,What does the button on the left with a small hole on the top of it do?

pm9CYCllfFg,"I agree, don't put it on the dark screen"
pm9CYCllfFg,How do you turn on voice commands in video mode?

32EeGI4hyTc,Do you think the A15 is a worthy upgrade?
32EeGI4hyTc,"the fact that nowadays you can get an amoled display with 90hz in a low-end phone without sacrificing too much the camera and the hardware departments, is crazy to me"
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing❤
The A15 is the pick for me💯"
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing - Thank you for the clear and quick review. DEFINITELY made my decision easier. I NEVER comment on videos but I've never found a review as ""layman friendly"""
32EeGI4hyTc,Amazing.  I will definitely pick A15.
32EeGI4hyTc,"Excelente información para decidir la compra de teléfono de entrada y con soporte de actualización de seguridad de 5 años, es bacan.
Saludos desde Trujillo Perú"
32EeGI4hyTc,"Guys trust me it is worth it i bought the a14 when it was released it did have some small lags, not very smooth scrolling and display,very slow charging. 
I bought the a15 two days ago i noticed a very big difference animation, scrolling, fast charging, better colors but dont buy the 4gb ram version buy 6 or 8"
32EeGI4hyTc,I own the A12 since 2020!! I think its time for an upgrade to A15 in 2024
32EeGI4hyTc,"Im currently using the Samsung A15, It is an amazing phone, good security, and an amazing screen! I very much recommend this phone."
32EeGI4hyTc,"@oscarmini 
can you please make a video of the a05s vs the a15"
32EeGI4hyTc,Thank you for this review! I just upgraded to the Samsung AG 15 5G because Straight Talk is running a special till January where you can  get a free Samsung ag15 5G with a 45.00 month card purchase🎉

32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing
I still don't know what kind of phone I want but im on a tight budget so nothing too expensive"
32EeGI4hyTc,Nice one
32EeGI4hyTc,Amazing😊
32EeGI4hyTc,Please do a computer between Samsung A15 and a05s😂
32EeGI4hyTc,I'm keeping my Samsung A24
32EeGI4hyTc,Amazing.
32EeGI4hyTc,"Am changing from redmi 13c to Samsung A15, any advice?"
32EeGI4hyTc,Yes it is worth an upgrade
32EeGI4hyTc,This is amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,how much better is a14 batt life? minutes? hours?
32EeGI4hyTc,Amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,a15 or redmi note 12 ?
32EeGI4hyTc,Which is fater between the A15 & the A15 5G
32EeGI4hyTc,The Samsung Galaxy A1x series is very good this year...
32EeGI4hyTc,the video sound of the A14 is notorious of being bad... is the A15 any better.
32EeGI4hyTc,Awesome
32EeGI4hyTc,"I don’t know if one ui 6 will have a core version

Maybe they will scrap the core version"
32EeGI4hyTc,But how much is it in retail price
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 ❤
32EeGI4hyTc,"I prefer narrower a14 display, ascpect ratio, a15 good spec, but they shouldnt had changed aspect ratio"
32EeGI4hyTc,Although the A15 has an amoled display it's resolution and pixel density is inferior to the A 14. Having looked at both side by side the 14 has a sharper display so to my eyes the amoled display is pointless !
32EeGI4hyTc,Resolution is fhd+ not hd+
32EeGI4hyTc,"The A14 was 60 bucks QVC Tracphone ,I now Have 3,400 Minutes Phone and5000 texts  ,Buy New every Year and Transfer minutes, No monthly.."
32EeGI4hyTc,I like you 😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
32EeGI4hyTc,Yap all things being equal
32EeGI4hyTc,But AMOLEDs are susceptible to green lines and led burns.
32EeGI4hyTc,Actually the A15 is FHD+ not HD+
32EeGI4hyTc,"But a14 😂 is good yoh..its just fighting with processing power for pictures, but if you check the videos, it's leading my guy.."
32EeGI4hyTc,Me watching this video on my redmi 13c no overheating or lagging redmi do all
32EeGI4hyTc,Got tthe a14 for 75 out the door
32EeGI4hyTc,this is so hard?
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 only work with one sim
32EeGI4hyTc,😅 Amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,Okay
32EeGI4hyTc,Test M14
32EeGI4hyTc,Realme gt6 is far beetter than these two
32EeGI4hyTc,Motorola g24.. cheaper option..
32EeGI4hyTc,😅I e and impressive
32EeGI4hyTc,Noooo the a14 have 90hz screen

SuIl1KRWhSc,"A good enough phone for those who just need a basic smartphone with basic usage. Nothing fancy here, but still solid."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got A15, 5G today. I like it.."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Ive been using a15 for 1 month now and it's a great phone
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Just bought one of these for my teenage son, his last phone unfortunately tanked. Really brilliant budget smart phone"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"man headphone jack + microsd is wild to see today, and totally sells me on it"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Good phone. Samsung's budget phones are becoming better. A few comments about the video. First, I'm happy you brought the speaker test sounds back. Second, you forgot about the selfie photo quality. But great review. Looking forward to that of the S24 ultra. Thanks."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Hooray...Snow This Time... Absolutely Splendid...
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I purchased one today and I am very happy. $170 out the door. Does the same thing as all the other Samsung phones, just a little slower. I love the single speaker at bottom. Very loud."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"3:30 25W charging is a nice update, but no charger in the box. And I still thank Samsung for saving the world more."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I bought the s20 fe this week  for the same price, and it's really good ,battery not the best but I'm planing to change it  ,I think buy old good phone better then new cheap phone 😊"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Has been a great work phone, I have an IPhone 15 pro Max for my daily personal but this Samsung was brought as mine for management and so far it's been great for what it is"
SuIl1KRWhSc,My favorite YouTuber by far I watch all of your reviews
SuIl1KRWhSc,for what its worth at least Samsung is stepping up their official software support game.
SuIl1KRWhSc,For a13 the a15 a real succesor finally
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn. Surveillance quality videos.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Many people just ask if it's this or that... You buy and see a cheap product with many updates, a nice design and a relatively solid memory space. That phone pushes well and works, and whether it has a headphone jack and whether it runs certain games without crashing, it doesn't matter whether it has or doesn't have a headphone jack, there are always headphones with a type C input... For certain games, you buy the S series and you don't complicate it for $200, you can't expect it to applaud you and the battery is saved just like the phone."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Looking at benchmark results, it can be summed up as ""What if the S9 had a battery?"""
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Bought Today, Great Phone🎉"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got this phone to replace my a03..a15 4g is a good phone after a month of usage. Videos, camera, social media, casual gaming are execellent no lag no heating battery is good. I love samsung compare to chinese phones."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"i have a 52s 5g and an A15  4g....so far A15 runs as smoothly as my 52, if you dont overload it with apps, its running fast and smooth as hell..also the 128 gb storage and the 4 gb ram is tremendous for a cheap phone like that- but what is a 10/10 is its battery!!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Great review of Samsung a24, i mean a15"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from my brand new A15 im so loving it❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn that blue looks hot
SuIl1KRWhSc,"3:53 PDAF& OIS, it only has AF, and it also gets 4 years os updates it says on samsung"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I love that it has a decently modern 6nm chipset, great for battery life, but those AMOLED screens are more of a liability, shadows and more sensitive to impacts. OIS would be nice. The SD card and headphone jack are great."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Most people don't use half the shit on their phone. Buying a $2000 phone is ridiculous. This is just fine.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Hello Will, please help me.  I want to know where I can buy the same earrings you have in this videos...? 🙏🏼"
SuIl1KRWhSc,just bought this right now from amazon canada for 170$ it'll be here in a few days ill let you know how it went.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Just upgraded from the A13 and the difference in quality is crazy
SuIl1KRWhSc,The bezels are iconic 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I want to know if Samsung  A15 will also have Samsung Cloud Back up, like we have on the Flagship Phones"
SuIl1KRWhSc,For a budget phone it looks hella good.
SuIl1KRWhSc,This is similar to a24 and that is amazing 👏 😮
SuIl1KRWhSc,Headphone jack and microSD in 2024? On a $120 phone? What a steal!
SuIl1KRWhSc,A15 5g is really awesome❤❤.no complaints 🎉🎉
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Using ot right now, its a very good phone for its phone extraordinary value!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"In your opinion, will this phone be a good alternative for a travel phone? One that mostly is used to take pics, Google Maps, Translate, and to communicate through WhatsApp,Facebook, and use UBER or other transport. apps? I got my normal cell phone  but need a second one just for travel and one that be inexpensive but good enough to manage esim,pics and what we mostly use overseas while traveling."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from A15❤❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,This is my new phone because i lost my old phone and it's good
SuIl1KRWhSc,3:57 There's no OIS.
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just purchase this phone on Amazon for $130.00 for a friend in the Caribbean..i think she would be happy with my choice..all she need it to make calls and text and this phone is plenty for her needs..good review by the way
SuIl1KRWhSc,Are you able to hide the notch like the old times?
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this and don't mind it
SuIl1KRWhSc,"no deep camera/video test, i just finished with this channel"
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this phone. 6gb ram really makes butter smooth.
SuIl1KRWhSc,I am dying  to know if this is the last samsung phone ever not to have 5g network... what do you think?.. please answer..
SuIl1KRWhSc,"a24 or a15 
please advise which one is better"
SuIl1KRWhSc,I got the 5g version today!!
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Can this phone be used in the USA with a SIM from a network outside the USA?
My phone that I was using for my congo sim broke down. and I wanted to buy this Samsung A15 for my congo sim. will it work? note that I am in the USA. THANKS"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Waooo... Going to get it immediately
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching  it on my a35 5g  looking  good
SuIl1KRWhSc,Which phone will be a step up from this one? Without upping price very much. I need better camera than the A15.
SuIl1KRWhSc,I haven't seen an Angie video in forever 😢 Is she still at GSMArena?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks Samsung top notch until 2030
SuIl1KRWhSc,It has the exact same external build as the A55?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Can it still work until 6-8 years?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Does this phone has call recording option without informing the call reciever?
SuIl1KRWhSc,A52 or A15 4G? I need help🤧
SuIl1KRWhSc,perfect phone to buy for your parents
SuIl1KRWhSc,U got it wrong it has 4 yrs os update and 5 yrs security
SuIl1KRWhSc,Am going to buy a 15 very soon 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,The new battery life score is confusing to look at unless you compare it to phones that has both the old and the new scores on their site.
SuIl1KRWhSc,This Samsung a15 have otg and possible to connect lavallier wireless microphone  for vlogging
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thank you
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I think there is a mistake, the A15 does not have OIS"
SuIl1KRWhSc,What about the front camera?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching this from my a15 4g🎉
SuIl1KRWhSc,Any problems or issues with it?
SuIl1KRWhSc,I need the Review of Galaxy A15 5G 🙏
SuIl1KRWhSc,is it eMMC ?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Can you do A15 4G vs A24 4G, as well as A25 5G vs A34 5G and A15 5G vs A23 5G? The A24 and A15 are not fully identical."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Is it emmc5.1 or ufs 2
SuIl1KRWhSc,I like way he present  phone and review
SuIl1KRWhSc,Next galaxy a05 normal ??
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just ordered one of amazon like 5 mins ago
SuIl1KRWhSc,how much prize
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks Redmi. Without you Samsung would not have pushed Amoled screens to that segment.
SuIl1KRWhSc,The way I hate that notch with passion
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Kapok beli hp samsung, S21 plus layar tiba-tiba garis hijau, tidak jatuh, tidak kena air, tidak sedang update system, ke service Center Samsung Yogyakarta kena biaya 1 juta untuk mengganti lcd padahal masih dalam masa garansi, kemudian ganti lcd baru. Tapi selang 2 bulan layar kembali bermasalah muncul garis hijau. Sekarang saya biarkan..."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Does A15 support smart view?
SuIl1KRWhSc,The only upgrade I saw on this one is the screen an the charging speed it don't worth upgrading from the 14
SuIl1KRWhSc,"What is it with these tech reviews and not doing research? This device is promised 4 os updates, not 3, and 5yrs security patches, not 4"
SuIl1KRWhSc,What color is it ?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"If it doesnt support HDR, what does that mean? Looks like the picture quality is poor. Can anyone confirm this, I'm considering buying this phone. I currently use A30s, but it has developed multiple lines on the screen."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Samsung is a multi-billion dollar company, I can't see why they opted to use ""Virtual proximity sensing"" in their cheaper phones, actual physical sensors have worked so well for years and costs nothing to implement, Virtual proximity sensing is a complete non starter."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"How does this phone compare to xiaomi redmi note 11? I'm so over xiaomi phones now,"
SuIl1KRWhSc,I got the a25 5g
SuIl1KRWhSc,Is it worth the extra cash for de 5g versión?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Is that 4gb of ram or 8gb of ram?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn tear drop again 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,Has google assistant also
SuIl1KRWhSc,I came here cos my xuaomi cant off pop up ads.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Tremenda maquina gran capacidad y incluso mas rapido que el a35
SuIl1KRWhSc,These budget samsung galaxy phones or worth the money than the high price flag phones that don't have a headphones jack just a pity they're not coming with the charger inside the box and you don't get the headphones with it
SuIl1KRWhSc,"4 major os upgrade not 3
Also 5 years of security updates"
SuIl1KRWhSc,same price as the a14 here in Italy now
SuIl1KRWhSc,I care less about the camera for as long as it is a gaming phone am going to buy it
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I've got this phone around 3 months back it's very good phone and I recommend it, if you're you're using it for the connection 4G solid Choice especially with this range price which considerable cheap."
SuIl1KRWhSc,does anyone find it troublesome how dark it is?
pfOUdk6PpsY,The most important thing for me is the android update policy (a15 gives u 4 major updates and a16 dives u 6 major updates). that means the a16 will take longer to become obsolete!
pfOUdk6PpsY,Prácticamente es lo mismo.
pfOUdk6PpsY,"Defo a15, cheaper while having same features and also 3.5mm headphone jack"
pfOUdk6PpsY,Le A16 aura android 20 dans le futur ou rien a voir ?
pfOUdk6PpsY,A16❤❤❤❤
pfOUdk6PpsY,Can I create a pin to unlock my phone?
pfOUdk6PpsY,Fake video no 3.5 mm jack a16 Samsung
pfOUdk6PpsY,I got the Samsung Galaxy a15 this past summer I should have waited for the a16 to come out
pfOUdk6PpsY,Quanto está
pfOUdk6PpsY,Super duper third class product of samsung after 14 months only it's never work and need 12000 for repairing

0yp6ygN3m3o,How much does a Samsung A 15 5G LCD cost?
0yp6ygN3m3o,How to buy it
0yp6ygN3m3o,How much screen A 15
0yp6ygN3m3o,"This is not a broken glass repair, It is rather a replacement."
0yp6ygN3m3o,"After replacing my screen, the touch was twitching after 3 days😢"
0yp6ygN3m3o,My phone is not powering up after breaking the screen.
0yp6ygN3m3o,For some reason I still get a black screen after replacement
0yp6ygN3m3o,So in fixed this and for some reason the ear speaker is not working I watched the video and didn't see anything bout that anybody know why??
0yp6ygN3m3o,"Bro, can i used the lcd of samsung A50 to samsung a15?"
VDwxEagh188,"I bought this phone Samsung A15  about a month ago'  and i have to say this is a great phone, its fast has a lot or storage and a great battery, like the screen very nice and has  great sound, love the ( yellow color)  two people in my family and my friend bought this same phone this week and they really like it,  We all enjoy this phone glad we purchased it."
VDwxEagh188,"That's what I'm going to buy. I don't like poco and redmi, my friend's poco x6 pro was thrown away because it turned off suddenly while playing games. Samsung legit is still good."
VDwxEagh188,Just letting people know you can boost the volume without using a sound booster. It called media volume limit. I will put up a description of f how to do it if people are unable to do it. 🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,"As phones keep getting expensive, I ended up getting this phone recently and loving it so far. The only downside was that it does not have always on display but other than that happy with my purchase."
VDwxEagh188,"I""m still here when come to samsung phones i like is the software & security updates i do own one of this phone myself 😍✌️"
VDwxEagh188,"Loving my a15 5g. Seems to be a little bit slower than my a14 5g,but not a big deal considering all that is on this phone. The size and design fits my hand so much better than the a14 5g."
VDwxEagh188,"I swapped my old Iphone 7 plus to this. I only add Php3000. 
I love it."
VDwxEagh188,My biggest complaint is no wireless charging especially with all of the modern day technology.
VDwxEagh188,"i bought this coz of your reviews. i use this as a secondary phone to my Galaxy A34 5G.

yes i also have the February security patch. i got the 8/256GB variant. it has only the hybrid SIM tray in our country. and so far i love using my A15 5G. it has no problems. everything is very good for the price. i have no problems with it."
VDwxEagh188,This device is kinda like the J7 or J7 prime on steroids!!!!!
VDwxEagh188,Awesome review. I got this phone. I love it
VDwxEagh188,Excellent comprehensive review.
VDwxEagh188,"3.5 mm Jack,Cheap,Great battery,Oled Display..Sir,take my money and give me that phone"
VDwxEagh188,I bought mine 6 months ago and now the screen has frozen and I can't use it?
VDwxEagh188,"Hey what stand are you using to film the phone? It looks cool! Send a link please, super interested!"
VDwxEagh188,Great review bro got a question for you does this have Smart view for screen mirroring to the tv 🤔
VDwxEagh188,Its a great phone
VDwxEagh188,"I recently saw one of these Samsung A15 5g phones in my local Walmart and I was impressed with this screen quality and the build too.  How would you say performance in regards to multitasking holds up?  Also, do those matte screen protectors make a difference with the phone out in direct sunlight?  I enjoy content on the budget devices to see what they’re capable of, keep up the great content!"
VDwxEagh188,"You just earned yourself a new subscriber.

I love your honest review.

Can this Phone do Front and Back video recording at same time?"
VDwxEagh188,"planning to have a15 this month, is it dual sim?"
VDwxEagh188,I’m still here
VDwxEagh188,I have the phone and seems like it's a decent phone. On Wifi it's like smooth butter but on the 5g network data it's so damn slow and just turns and buffers most of the damn time! I called boostmobile and i seem to have good coverage but this phone is so slow. And unfortunately it's impossible to be on Wifi all the time. I really wanna throw the phone out the window!!! 🙄😬
VDwxEagh188,Planned obsolescence just like that every other phone without a user replaceable battery.
VDwxEagh188,please show me your case name and where to buy it. Thank you!
VDwxEagh188,"Do you have the 4G version to compare with? And do these thing reload backgrounded apps a lot?
My lg with 8gb started refreshing apps sent to background as the updates came along. It sucks."
VDwxEagh188,Could you please name the case you are using again I'm unable to find it. I need that case. 😁🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,i have a question i bought this phone everything is good but i am facing issue with its proximity sensor its screen do not switch off when i take the phone to ear and also when i play the voice note in whatsapp its screen don't switch off and also voice comes from loud speaker when i take to my ear
VDwxEagh188,Is this phone better than the A52s 5G?
VDwxEagh188,"Are sure that ram plus boost it to 8gb? , i only see 4"
VDwxEagh188,"I am buy this phone tomorrow, if they use the virtual ram for background processes and the physical ram is not being used for that then its already good. N1 killer on smartphones are the background apps running. If you have a LCD screen like me and going to super Amoled, then the screen is going to be God tier and it has a good camera for me coming from a Nokia G20. The Nokia G20 that I have has sometimes artifacting in the instagram and youtube shorts, can't watch 720p 60fps video without lagging and on some objects the camera does not focus. Nokia G20 is not a bad phone, it's software is not good. I don't blame the hardware, but I always blame the software."
VDwxEagh188,I'm overseas is it okay  for the Caribbean 🇭🇹 Halla 256 GB
VDwxEagh188,But i am facing problem like its draining 2x faster than normal playing of 5 to 6 min of utube consumes exactly 1% every time any solution for this...?
VDwxEagh188,How strong its build in Bluetooth?
VDwxEagh188,A15 is a AMOLED  bro not lcd
VDwxEagh188,A15 or a34 who worth to buy??
VDwxEagh188,💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
VDwxEagh188,"sir, you accidentally leaked your phone number!"
VDwxEagh188,This phone takes good pictures in the back but the selfie camera is not as crispy and detailed like the back camera is doing I just got this phone 3 days ago and I like everything about it except the selfie camera I have a Huawei p30 lite and the selfie camera is 34mp and takes really good detail pictures in the back and front and I paid 200 something for that one and I paid 200 something for the new galaxy a15 but that selfie camera is not it

iso6qgCo6vI,"I'm a 73 yr old woman getting my first smartphone.  I've been feeling a little fearful and overwhelmed with the technology.  I wouldn't even know how to turn it on.  Thank you so much for a clear, easily understandable training.  I'm feeling a lot more confident about the phone arriving on Monday."
iso6qgCo6vI,Outstanding!  A non-tech-savvy family member just bought one of these phones and I have had my hands full trying to explain to him how his phone works.  This video is a perfect introduction to the A15.
iso6qgCo6vI,You have changed my world with this video! Thank you for clear and understandable instructions for us older folks
iso6qgCo6vI,"Very nice presentation for beginners and old farts. I'm an old fart, and these phones scare me. You made me so comfortable with my new A15 . I had an older version Galaxy J7, and only did the basics with it. I feel more at home when I pick it up now. your video gets 2 thumbs up for clarity and complete explanations for what you covered. Thanks"
iso6qgCo6vI,I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy. I am a senior citizen and this video was very informative. I thank you very much. I will be watching more of your videos.
iso6qgCo6vI,"FINALLY!!!!!  GREAT VIDEO FOR 80 YEAR OLD LADIES!!!!  NICE AND PATIENT, NO ""SALAD LANGUAGE"".  SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS!  THIS NEW PHONE HAS BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS.  THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH.  I'LL BE LOOKING FOR MORE FROM YOU."
iso6qgCo6vI,"After updating from a phone that was 7-9 years old, this was very valuable. Well presented !"
iso6qgCo6vI,"This video for the phone I just bought was a life saver!  Am elderly and very tech challenged!  Tried the first video by someone else and immediately turned it off.  Then I found your video.  Easy to understand and pause, as needed.  I highly recommend this video.  Liked and subscribed.  Going to watch all of your videos that pertain to my Samsung Galaxy 15.  Was seriously about to turn in and pay the restocking fee to get rid of the phone.  With your help, am going to be able to maneuver the phone and do everything I need to do!  Thank you so much!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you very much indeed for such a great presentation.   Very easy to understand and I can now do everything on my new A15  (at the age of 81 years!)     You are a brilliant tutor!   From Herefordshire, England."
iso6qgCo6vI,That whole thing was AWESOME!! Thank u so much.  At 88 going from Galaxy 6 to A15 I really needed lots of help.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for explaining this well.  Some of it is over my head, and I can only do a little at a time.  I have had this phone for about a month and was so happy when I found your video!  There’s so much I don’t know how to do.  I’ll keep listening.  I may have to play this a few times,  but am grateful you made it.  ❤

My gripe is the lady at the T-Mobile store was mean.  She made me cry and feel so stupid I just got my stuff and left.  T-Mobile, however, responded quickly and so caringly — they are not going to bill me till December because the woman was so mean, and they said they don’t tolerate that — especially being so nasty to a 25-year customer.  Good service from T-Mobile!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so much for the video.  The section on how to add a different email was my absolute favorite, I now have my email on my phone, very pleased!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"How to make a call at 24:02!  So many of these ""basic"" videos assume we already know that.  I'm 78  and this is my first cell phone of any kind.  As AT&T cut my landline off I was home alone with no way to call 911 in an emergency.  Now I can!  Thank you!"
iso6qgCo6vI,Huge thanks - after charging up my phone I was clueless how to even switch it on and thank goodness for your video - I'm at 30 mins and will continue the rest tomorrow - amazingly helpful! 😁
iso6qgCo6vI,"fANTASTIC vIDEO , thank you very very much.
I am 80 years old ans still learning.!!!
Looking forward to your next videos.

iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you. ALL great information.  I would love to know how to change ringtones and incoming messages for my Favorite people in my contacts.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so very much for this great video!!! I just bought this phone today and by watching you run through so many functions, I feel like I might just know what I am doing with it, even after just a few hours of owning it. YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Mate - I'm only half way through this video.... THANK YOU!!!! Great guidance. I have friends who ""clicki de click - clack - its fixed!"" but thats not the same as learning for yourself. Thanks, fella. this video sorted out a lot of problems."
iso6qgCo6vI,"This video was well explained. Just got this phone, so I am starting from scratch, from a Flip Phone. Big difference  with so much to learn."

iso6qgCo6vI,great video can't figure out how to set up voicemail

iso6qgCo6vI,"Absolutely brilliant! Superb explanations and demonstrations of the buttons and their use. Easy to understand and so, so helpful Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post."
iso6qgCo6vI,I like the way you teach and model step by step the navigation process on the phone. It was very helpful so that I can show it to my beginning cell buyers and they need to know basically the fundamentals and navigation of using a cell phone.
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you for helping me figure this phone out. You are a jewel.❤
iso6qgCo6vI,"2 issues I have with my A15.
the first is the size of the bubble when texting.  I've read that there is no way to enlarge this at all in the vertical mode in order to see more than 4 lines of text and edit them.  The only recommendation was to go landscape in order to get a wider bubble, which is still only 4 lines though.  Is there another way?
Next, and this could just be an issue with the app, but using the GPS which I do often, I get a text or email that I want/need to look at but the controls for the app only shrink it but it still covers up a lot of my messages even though I can move it around.  The ""home screen button"" just isn't there.  Suggestions?"
iso6qgCo6vI,Loved the  presentation.  It was easy to follow along.  Glad I came upon this tutorial.
iso6qgCo6vI,believe it or not I wasn't swiping the phone right and had to call everyone back.  Thank you and I will watch it again.
iso6qgCo6vI,"I too am an old fart, ploughing through 150 pages made my head spin,but you have made it so simple ,thank you"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you.  I was going back to the shop tomorrow!!!! X
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you for the everything it was all helpful. How to save a new phone number?
iso6qgCo6vI,"At last,A very big Thank you😊"
iso6qgCo6vI,Just got this A15 phone Great Video. Thank you a big help starting with new phone.
iso6qgCo6vI,Very helpful❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank You so much for sharing
iso6qgCo6vI,"great explainations,thanks"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Great video, very helpful and instructive. One thing I missed - how to take a screenshot - would it be possible to let us know what to do. Thanks"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you so much.  Best instruction for new phone.  Please do more!!!!
iso6qgCo6vI,Thx 4 this video...am having to rerun it a lot to make sure I know what I'm doing! ?4U: Can I use my sim card from my old tracfone [A11] Samsung Galaxy A15? What is a sim card anyway?
iso6qgCo6vI,Good video how do I put 2 step verification code  while I am in an app?
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you, Wayne, for the video. Question on my a15 when I'm using an app or a game, and I get out of it just for a few min. When I  tried to return to the app or game using the 3 line bottom left button. the phone doesn't  let me return to where I  left off. The phone usually restarts the game or app I was using.  How do I  fix that ? Thank you, James"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thanks! very informative video!
iso6qgCo6vI,I promise I have not paid this phone that much attention. Thank you ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,do you have a video-how to setup voicemail Samsung A15
iso6qgCo6vI,"Wayne, when you say the phone is ""asleep"" and accordingly still ON,  that suggests to me it is still using power and therefore draining the battery.  Would it therefore not be a better idea to turn it off completely to prevent this happening?"
iso6qgCo6vI,"I've always had a S Galaxy & the button's, ( volume, etc,etc) on the left side. It's driving me nuts that they switched  side. And always swiped down from the top, not up. Swiping from the homescreen, which should be set to easy mode for us older folks. I hope there is one Ui home. You've certainly covered in depth, which can get confusing. I just hit the button on the homescreen that is  all the apps & all your apps come up like pages in a book. This swiping up is very confusing. I don't mind turning the pages, so to speak. For older people we need things that are easy & also picking the accessibility for font, style of, magnifier for older people. Changing to dark mode. I've never been able to pick up my phone & talk. I always use speaker function. The first thing I wish I could do is get Google off my phone. I use Firefox for my browser. Google takes over everything, including my Gallery. They ruined my photos now, separating them into albums, etc,etc.
Whatever I do is stay away from Google. Of course, Google won't leave you alone. Firefox protects you, Google sells all your information. Well, now you're getting into the font size 😂.  Thank You"
iso6qgCo6vI,Very informative. Thanks
iso6qgCo6vI,Very well presented. thank you.
iso6qgCo6vI,Fantastic presentation; thanks so much for taking the time to post this.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Great video, very handy.  But as a first time cellphone owner, it may seem pretty basic, but when I just got it, no sim in it and no clue about setting up an account or service (I was advised to use public mobile) and I am fairly clueless about sims, though I do understand them a little bit.  Something for the absolute newbie, covering getting a sim, getting a service to use etc... would be helpful.  I noticed a lot of videos online assume you already have a sim and service, but I haven't found any to cover if you do not (I am on a computer presently).  I assume it is fairly straight forward and simple, but not when you don't know anything about these.  Thanks."
iso6qgCo6vI,I liked this video! This video helped me a lot. Thanks! ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Bought one a few days ago and the battery 🔋 quality is good I just installed a 256 sd card to transfer my apps and files on the card i heard about the A16 doesn't have a headset jack but you can get one online and it available at 5 below
iso6qgCo6vI,"Ditto everyone else.
Thank you"
iso6qgCo6vI,EXCELLENT tutorial. THX!
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so much. I was having an anxiety attack! I would like my phone to do a better job of voice to text. Also my new phone send a second text, a duplicate of the first text?"
iso6qgCo6vI,It was all helpful. Thank you!
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks so much for the help! Really appreciate it. I'm still confused about how to set up SMS Messenger as default and why I should set up that one versus the existing red text. When I press set up as default button nothing happens. Also I'd love to know how I can move over my notes from notes app from old droid to new droid  rather than manually having to type them in. If you have other resources or ever decide to do video on these topics please let me know, but really GREAT video. I also LOVE that they have captions so if there's a topic that I need to focus on I can scan right to it. Thanks for your service. 😇"

iso6qgCo6vI,"What a super tutorial, thanks for posting. My A15 5g arrives in 2 days as my first smartphone so I want to be up and running when it arrives.

One query, you downloaded the Uber app as an example and it displayed on your second page of apps, is there a way to move it onto the first page? Also, will I be able to delete preloaded apps that don't interest me to save space?

Once again, many thanks."

o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you for the video. Great work as always!!!
o6yNybwt0hM,"I just got this phone and love it so far. I literally ordered it online, added a sturdy case and had it delivered to my workplace in about 40 minutes, all for under $200 inclusing taxes and delivery fees/tips. It is a lot of bang for your buck as they say. Some of the features I like are the screen quality, fingerprint reader, micro SD card capability and the food old fashioned head phone jack."
o6yNybwt0hM,"I previously owns galaxy m31 since 2020, now i bought galaxy a15 5g new  , experience is awesome fluid, lag free, 5g network coverage is awesome, battery performance in 5g is awesome, sound is loud and clear. I'm from india, my first phone was also Samsung in 2008,"
o6yNybwt0hM,Just got this because my trusty A51 BRICKED! Good thing I had everything backed up. I really like the fingerprint reader on the thumb instead on the screen. Got a really good armor case for it and it feel rock solid. Looking forward to a good long life with it!
o6yNybwt0hM,Great content. Thank you. I just ordered mine. I too am disgusted by $1000+ electronic leashes.
o6yNybwt0hM,The Blue Samsung Galaxy A15 8gb of RAM with a Storage of 256gb with a Micro SD card slot 2tb ready
o6yNybwt0hM,This is the right phone for my 77 years old Mom ❤ and Unt 😁 thanks for the info.
o6yNybwt0hM,"My new phone got stolen (s24, no insurance, yeah I know lol). Had to pull my backup phone out of retirement (iphone 8 plus, still in great condition, using it right now btw) but that left me having to buy another phone outright (I keep 2 phones). Found this phone on Amazon and should receive soon. Didn’t think “cheap” phones still existed but I’m so glad they do. I don’t need all the bells and whistles so this A15 will be just fine for my needs but its funny to think this “cheap” phone is basically what phones were 5-10 years ago lol. Amazing."
o6yNybwt0hM,I purchased the Samsung A15 two weeks ago and am still learning how to use it.  So far I like it if I can remember my new phone number on it.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Was at the store yesterday, couldn't help noticing the Galaxy A15 has a yellowish tint on its display, eventhough the eye comfort feature has been unchecked. Comparing it side by side with the A05, the latter didn't have the same prob."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Am a seventy-year-old new Galaxy A15 user. It's been less than two weeks. As a senior, there's always a learning curve on any new device. The user manual is a joke! What's the deal with a C-to-C charger cable? Luckily, I still had a C to USB charger cable from my old phone."
o6yNybwt0hM,I love the finger bio-metric button. It works like a charm.
o6yNybwt0hM,"#1, too heavy.  Much of what you said is Greek to me LOL.  I do agree with the charging.  I wasn't thrilled to have such a ton of apps pre loaded, but I'm an old lady & mostly just use phone, messaging and maps."
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got it for my birthday yesterday
o6yNybwt0hM,"Thanks  for  the review ! I was  also disappointed that the A15  has  4Gb of ram in 2024. Teardrop  notch vs  punch hole  doesn't  bother me. No 25 watt charger included ?? Come on.   Like   the 4 year  OS upgrades and brighter , smaller super amoled  screen.  On the  fence  though.  Considering   Moto g power 5G. 2023..  more  ram,(6Gb)   more storage , stereo speakers Even though  it only has 1  upgrade to Android 14,  its  always  goes on sale(199.99 unlocked). I still have a  moto g Play  from 2018,lol .Samsung phones never   go on sale (unlocked) even  when  new  models  are about to come  out."
o6yNybwt0hM,"I have the Samsung Galaxy A15 5 G, but some of the texts I receive say to tap & download, but nothing the little blue thing just keeps circling.  How can I fix this so I get to read all my text messages?"
o6yNybwt0hM,"Love your videos, man! Pretty sure I'll be grabbing a couple of these for my Daughters at Christmas time!"
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone a few days ago and it's amazing i love it 😍😍
o6yNybwt0hM,Charging the a14 might be set to adaptive so it slow charges then hurrys up the last 20% depending on how long you leave it on the charger. Not sure if you messed with it yet.
o6yNybwt0hM,Ordered one today - will come back and let you know how it went.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Mine has been freezing up, and at times, you can't restart it or shut it off. Coming from far more expensive phones it's fine but I don't like how thick it is and the size is too short but I knew this going in. 
I don't like the power button as it seems harder to find than most others at night.
The screen capture works, but it was far easier to find and figure out on my previous phones.

In the end I am fine with it. The freezing started after the last update, and hopefully, it will get sorted out."
o6yNybwt0hM,My brother loves this phone so much that he just purchased another one.
o6yNybwt0hM,Is this phone good for general purpose like phone calls youtube camera and stuff...??? Shld i buy this ...
o6yNybwt0hM,Is it better than the moto g stylus 5g 2023?
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone today and Really it's nice
o6yNybwt0hM,I just purchased this phone and its awesome..Great video
o6yNybwt0hM,Gonna buy this maybe nextweek 😊
o6yNybwt0hM,"I just got the A15 and will say it is an upgrade, but not a massive upgrade. However, I am still happy with the A13."
o6yNybwt0hM,In just my day to day living I have never heard anyone complain about the bezels on their phones. Except tech YouTubers. Also once you slap an OtterBox (my choice of case) on your phone you literally don't notice them anyway. As long as the viewing experience is good and the battery life is good I am very happy with this phone.
o6yNybwt0hM,if i want to upgrade to this is it worth it is it cameras good or should i go flagship
o6yNybwt0hM,"What storage version you have? Cause I saw in another video there is a version of 256gb storage, that is pretty damn good for the price"
o6yNybwt0hM,"As an older person who wanted just a Phone simple and simple. This phone is not simple. I came from a LG K8. Which was simple.  I only use a few apps.  PHONES should only come with a few apps and allow us to add what we want. I like using Maps apps and geocache.  Both needing a GPS sensor, triangulation and It has a crappy Sensor!!!  It can only get to within 12 meters. Vs 3 meters of my older phone. I'm So disappointed I've gone back to using my older phone."
o6yNybwt0hM,The phone is very good and the future is also great
o6yNybwt0hM,"Reminds me of the samsung j1, simple but got the job done"
o6yNybwt0hM,"My A15 5G's screen is far too sensitive. I bump it, switch hands, etc,  it lights up, leading to opening apps by ""accident"". It's a nearly constant problem. The slow charging has only recently become a problem."
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks very much for those details ❤
o6yNybwt0hM,Is Samsung Pay compatible with this phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you for saying it's not waterproof. It's an important thing if you live in Ireland where it rains often. My modest Oppo a16s is waterproof and is going strong after 2 years.
o6yNybwt0hM,How is the camera?
o6yNybwt0hM,Why can't I find the 256gb version anywhere from american websites without it being an international version of the phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,What's the thing with the bezels - near perfect design and the bezels are not an issue at all.
o6yNybwt0hM,Need to buy a new phone and I don't know what to choose moto edge 2023 moto g 5g pixel 7 or the Samsung A15 5g what would you suggest
o6yNybwt0hM,Nice review. Notice any PWM flicker ?
o6yNybwt0hM,Can someone tell me what to do coz I cannot watch netflix while I'm on whatsapp call?
o6yNybwt0hM,My mom is wanting to get me a new phone before I leave for college I don't need much so this one seems good for my needs thanks for the detailed review!! Personally I like the teardrop cameras but that's just a matter of taste ofc.
o6yNybwt0hM,90hz display on a mid range galaxy. iPhone non pro models are 60hz still and cost several hundred more dollars.
o6yNybwt0hM,Any way to get rid of the freezing and lag with this phone?? Having really bad issues with this one.
o6yNybwt0hM,"My pro: Pretty decent budget phone for 2024 model of phones.
My con: It doesn't have a slot for both a SIM 2 and a microSD card.
Although they did compensate with their 125Gb of storage.

In all, it's a pretty nice phone for minimalist users."
o6yNybwt0hM,I have the A13 and really wish this one were the same size. This one feels too thick and chunky.
o6yNybwt0hM,Does the A15 have always on display?
o6yNybwt0hM,"Hi thanks for the info just  purchased in mauritius but it is  made in India.
 Is it OK ???
Thank"
o6yNybwt0hM,Works well but absence of wireless inductive charging is frustrating.
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks for the info. This phone does not have wireless charger support.
o6yNybwt0hM,I have this device and love it so much. It's doing all it promised to do
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it get really hot to hold after awhile because heat was an issue in my other phone
o6yNybwt0hM,As of today I actually got this phone at Walmart for 66$ with tax included. Not a bad rig for the price as a straight talk phone
o6yNybwt0hM,"I got my A15 6gb ram 5g yesterday,  it's pretty good 👍."
o6yNybwt0hM,"I was so happy to learn from the comments here that I could insert my SD card under the SIM card, but the photos on the SD card came up as distorted, although on my computer, they looked just fine. We removed & re-inserted the SIM & SD card several times, but it didn't help the distortion. Also we rebooted the phone several times. Does anyone have a suggestion for me? Loved the video!"
o6yNybwt0hM,"As of Nov 22, 2024, Amazon has this phone at $115, 'refurbished'(Excellent condition). Just bought one and will try it with Mint mobile. Can you believe Deadpool has a phone company🤯"
o6yNybwt0hM,I got the A15 4g because I'm old school
o6yNybwt0hM,I purchased the Galaxy A15 5G same day while adding text contacts on my phone an ER message popped up requesting to enter my pin to unlock my phone. I don't know why my phone locked and where do I find my pin.
o6yNybwt0hM,There's samsung a15 on ebay that has 64gb instead of 128gb is the other upgrades the same?
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks for testing 💋🤩
o6yNybwt0hM,"Thanks for this video, God bless brother."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Regarding the cons: wider bezels and the dimple at the top - not looking up-to-date - are the last 2 things I would consider when buying any phone. A smartphone is a tool, and not something to show off. It's kind of like worrying about having an ugly bolt in the trunk of my car.

I don't play video games - most users don't. I want performance and speed, reliability and durability. This is a backup for me, and slower than my Pixel 8, but not so much that I couldn't use it. Camera isn't as good. A screen protector and case will make it far more durable for a cost of $10 to $15 - I've used them on flagships as well, and have never broken a phone or a screen."
o6yNybwt0hM,Both phones look premium equally because Samsung phones are made to look the same 😅so come on .but i get  It its advertising. Marketing. But you know i hope  this new one is as good as the A14 one.
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it have a screen recorder ? Or is it like the old models we have to wait for an update ?
o6yNybwt0hM,Simple question. Buy a case or not? Do people still buy cases like I always do?
o6yNybwt0hM,Why is every company giving it away for free
o6yNybwt0hM,The teardrop camera lens area is cleaned more easily compared to a phone with a screen protector having a cutout dot.
o6yNybwt0hM,What about the camera quality?
o6yNybwt0hM,I’ve had mine for 2 weeks now. I need to get a different charging cable as it doesn’t charge. I’m using my cable from my a10e. Also…I can’t set my notifications to differentiate between text and other notifications. Thx for the video.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Samsung is good, the bad thing only is the design.. Xiaomi had outsmarted Samsung when it comes to design 📢"
o6yNybwt0hM,I like the texxture on the a14 like glass and my fav color for the a15. Is like the navy blue matches my a9 plus
o6yNybwt0hM,Does the A15 have fm radio?
o6yNybwt0hM,are you from Europe? Why don't you have 8gb ram there? We have that option here in the Philippines and I'm planning to get a15 on the weekends.
o6yNybwt0hM,Support samsung dex ?
o6yNybwt0hM,"The ‘teardrop’ lens design is more of a marketing psy trick than anything.
A potential buyer will be more likely to plop a few more bucks for one without the obvious ‘old school’ look."
o6yNybwt0hM,The notch is not a big deal to me because you can usually hide the notch on any app you want and the only app that I want to hide the notch on is for YouTube.
o6yNybwt0hM,I just bought this phone do you know exactly which charger I need to buy?  thanks.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Amoled is inferior regardless of slight contrast.  I will look for my favorite ips display any day  it's more robust from breaking,  brighter in the sun, better viewing angle, more accurate color.  Thanks for reviewing"
o6yNybwt0hM,What about the phone's speaker? I hear the speaker is bad.
o6yNybwt0hM,Does Live FM radio work with this phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,I don't know about other countries but In Nepal we get free 25 watt Samsung original charger with phone itself and the base variant of this device in Nepal is 6/128 so it's perfect to buy
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it have wireless charging capability?
o6yNybwt0hM,Is this supposed to come with a sim card?  Mine didn't (Best Buy).  Can i use the sim from my A15 4G?
o6yNybwt0hM,"I had it for a few hours. It lagged and stuttered with just basic use, including Samsung's own apps. It was so bad that I returned it the same day."
o6yNybwt0hM,Mr TecRight? Can you still use a 20 watt charger?
o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you so much ❤
o6yNybwt0hM,Is the Samsung a15 5g better than the Samsung a32 5g? Im still using the A32 5g
o6yNybwt0hM,does A15 5G has wireless charge?  no reviews talk about it.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Is it a gaming phone , does it play genshin impact without lagging"
o6yNybwt0hM,So far so good. Just got this yesterday.  Still hasnt gotten that GREAT charge but it's super slow
o6yNybwt0hM,"Please say 
Samsung galaxy a15 is good gaming isn't it"
o6yNybwt0hM,Y'all should I buy that or the nothing phone CMF 1??
o6yNybwt0hM,"I was disappointed because the sales told me it has dual sim slots and an SD card slot. But after buying it (a Samsung Galaxy A15 4G) it can take two sim cards, but one would have to be removed if an SD card is installed. So kinda like I was conned by sales pitch. Anyway, according to my budget I will just have to keep it. My Samsung AO3S (which was stolen) had 3 slots, for two sim cards and an SD card."
o6yNybwt0hM,The back panel will come apart from over heating the back panel will come un glued!!!!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 3:56
o6yNybwt0hM,i have the a15.cant hook it up to my TV via hdmi to usdc cable..phone says it's charging the device.tv.device tv hdmi port is controlling usb..on phone.cant change in settings...why.anyone have issues  connecting hdmi to  usbc cable  to tv..
o6yNybwt0hM,"I love this  phone , you can't  beat it for the money."
o6yNybwt0hM,"When the screen is off, tap it three times. Screen will turn on. So sensitive when it's in your pocket."
il2QoQXkU_4,"If anyone isn't targetting for a flagship phone/high-end phone but a nice-enough phone, this one is actually a great choice as you can get 4 years of upgrading Androids. It's great to see Samsung is extending the lifespan of their budget phones."
il2QoQXkU_4,Woah it look better. In light blue and white wish they had stock in these color
il2QoQXkU_4,You can see that lag when he leaves settings 💀💀

il2QoQXkU_4,Phone lags like it came out in 1995 😭
il2QoQXkU_4,A15❤
il2QoQXkU_4,"Warning! AVOID SAMSUNG. I bought a Galaxy 24 Ultra 512 GB. The phone was constantly warm, the battery life was worse than on my S23+ and the fast charging didn´t work. Very bad quality. Contacted their technical support but they we unable to help me becaure the diagnostics system didn´t work for a whole week. They told me to take the phone to a repair shop. Unbelieveble! They want to repair a couple of weeks old premium phone ?!?! My feeling is that they do not care about their customers. Feels that you´re paying for a Ferrari buy they deliver a Lada. I do NOT recomment this device, it will disappoint you. I will not buy another Samsung product. Really bad service and while the technical support can´t help it is impossible to speak to somebody responsible."
il2QoQXkU_4,Whai is the made or manufactured  country?
il2QoQXkU_4,Made by vietnam❤ 🇻🇳 ❤

MN0qF-mAAyo,"I watched it once before, and that was my reaction too! As a beginner, when the person explaining how to use this is talking that fast, it's too fast to process each thing, before he moves to the next thing, etc"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Got Two Today From My Telco
Thanks for Your help ✌️👍"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine yesterday. The moment I saw it, I fell in love"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Very good explanation of this device.  Thank you for doing this.  My only difficulty was it was hard for me to digest what you were saying because - in my view - you talk too fast.
MN0qF-mAAyo,I love my A15. It goes great with my AR15.
MN0qF-mAAyo,Pull the screen down and there's a iron to take the screen shot and u can also do it by sweeping the side of ur hand across the screen and it'll take ur screen shot that way
MN0qF-mAAyo,Merci. very helpful 🇭🇹🎀🌻🍒
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine today on the samsung publicity video it says use smart switch to transfer your applications from another samsung phone, my new A 15 5g didn't have it and it took over an hour to install it,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Thank you so much, loved it!!"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Thank you for this !!
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I bought one of these yesterday but there's nothing on it. I can't believe I'm asking this, but how do I use it as a phone? I don't get that screen you got there at the beginning. No search bar, no apps under it. It's been a couple of hours since they deactivated my old phone, which was about 24 hours since I bought it. Do I need to wait? I phoned my Galaxy from my landline but it says it has not been possible to connect my call."
MN0qF-mAAyo,It’s good to have plastic on the back better than the fragile glass on other phones
MN0qF-mAAyo,just got my a15 🎉
MN0qF-mAAyo,I would like to see if I can get separate ringtones for text and notifications.
MN0qF-mAAyo,Mine came without a sim card? Why? Is this typical?? Help. What do I have to get or it? I've just used cheap basic phones that were all set up and I am lost and feel stupid. Thank you so much.
MN0qF-mAAyo,Can you show who to screenshot name of person and how to send in Samsung.
MN0qF-mAAyo,Camera 📷 is good  ?
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine a month ago. Works great except I'm not getting any notifications from YouTube. I've double checked all my settings and notifications are allowed from YT, but the only one I'm getting is a daily digest notification at 7 pm Eastern time."
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Can we teach the voice recognition component of this phone?  For instance, I want to dictate punctuation, but I get COMMA instead of a ,"

MN0qF-mAAyo,just got mine today
MN0qF-mAAyo,"yeah, @1:05 pretty insane? yes you think my now and years past, they could mount camera lens in the middle!!!!!!!. still decent phone,, too smooth yet still erratic. If I can get the speaker updated. The EQ presets done come close to what the speaker outputs.  It sound just like the sound comes out a square piece of tin,,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,You mentioned doing a screenshot from your help menu but I don't see that option on mine.

MN0qF-mAAyo,"For the instructional video, you will need to speak more slowly. You are here to teach people how to use an unknown device, especially for older people and twice especially for those with English as a second language.. So, instead of 9 minutes 31 seconds, spend 15 minutes. Thank you."
MN0qF-mAAyo,The split screen also you don't know how to used it ?
MN0qF-mAAyo,You talk WAY too fast!! Slow down!
MN0qF-mAAyo,How do I receive voicemail?

MN0qF-mAAyo,0:48
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Taken me days to sort out the camera and sound configuration after they went wrong. The phone (it’s a phone!) has too many technical features. Ok, It was bought in 2024 while my other phones are older and much easier to use."
MN0qF-mAAyo,Bro how to make icons small size I can't figure it out 😢
MN0qF-mAAyo,Very difficult to follow you as you speak way too quickly. You need to slow down so the listener can properly absorb what you have said.
MN0qF-mAAyo,I still can't find screenshot and screen recording in the phone.  How can i screenshot pls?
MN0qF-mAAyo,I Did not find this as  basic as  I  needed.   Never having had a Samsung phone before.   Plus I found you spoke too fast.

MN0qF-mAAyo,Where is the screenshot
MN0qF-mAAyo,"You speak to fast and do not enunciate well. It's had to follow your descriptions. I had to set the closed captions and still you speak so fast, no pauses between phrases to absorb what you're saying."
MN0qF-mAAyo,"You’re speaking to seniors and beginners. You speak too fast, too soft and don’t articulate your words. Appreciate the intent but could improve for your audience"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Can i play efootball game

6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I appreciate Long Term Reviews a lot. Thanks for this!
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,You sir are a blessing's in disguise. I'm planning to buy a15 LTE in December 2024. Thank you for this review great sir❤
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Awesome review! Pretty sure I'll be picking up a couple of these for my daughters at Christmas!
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Ive watched this video like a thousand times
I hope to get the a15 soon❤"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"I have the 4G LTE version and even though it's not as good as the 5G version, it's still a beast of a phone. 😊 Either way it's an A15, and just like it's predecessors the A14 4G LTE and 5G, these have both proven to be Samsung's best selling phones. ❤😁"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Honestly. The default settings on the pics are better than my over processed s24+. Sky and greenery colors aren't exaggerated with crazy blues and rich greens.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Watching from a15 4g , it's the best with heat management and the battery is difficult to complete.  It takes 2days from 100 percent it can play toe3 in high graphics"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,the 5G version has gyro sensor and video stabilization which are lacking on the 4G version.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Thankyou for sharing ☮️ I will be getting the 4g one this weekend… looking forward to it 😋
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Am watching this in 2025, am a Sammy fanboy but honestly ever since A13 most entry/budget phones arent appealing anymore, Samsung gimped them in one way or another to save costs & to offload excess spare parts,
A13 had a trash processor/soc
A14 had trash processor & cheap design/cheap screen
A15 tried to update the SoC but mostly becoz OneUI 6 is too heavy for the UI but the design, screen bezels & clicky buttons still say alot, also galaxy A1x loud speakers are always tin-sounding & easily blocked with fat fingers when you hold the phone
meanwhile the competition is doing More Storage, subjectively Better design & punch-hole screens with slimmer bezels & Better stereo loudspeakers, 
overall Motorola, Vivo & Transsion(Infinix, Tecno) are winning in 2024 & we hope 2025 is a new year of innovation & competitiveness from team galaxy, fingers crossed

Overall, thanks for the indepth & honest review, keep up the dope reviews, cheers"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,What about the storage? Would it be okay to buy the one with 8/256 gb?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Whats the big difference between 4G and 5G?

Is it a big upgrade?"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Genuinely good review and video ❤
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Just got mine last week it pretty good 👍
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Please also do some Tecno and Redmi long term review
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I love my A15 5G........8.7/10.....rate
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Does it have any protection?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Great review
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Currently watching this video on my Samsung Galaxy A15 4G.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Big up bro watching from Galaxy S24 Ultra ❤
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Watching from a a12. I can get the A15 5G free just have to buy my next phone card $50 with tax, so buy my next phone card and continue using the a12 or buy phone card and register for the free a15 5g.    I will save up and buy A35 or better later. Free is always good."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Whats better, the A22 4G or the A15 4G?"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Does thia have call recording option?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Unfortunately I could only find the 4Gb model available in Canada, which I've heard the OS version stretches thin..."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Basically Samsung phones have signal problems where there is low signal Samsung phone does not show any signals
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I'm looking to upgrade my Motorola to this phone 😊
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,thanks! I'll get it!
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I need help.I used Samsung A22 5g for almost 4 years. I became too much comfortable with it but it was stolen some months ago. Now i am confused should i buy my previous model or A15 5g.My previous phone had soo many useful features i am afraid that new models might not have those features 😔.please help.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Itel RS4 and A15 which one is ok for performance and for long term use
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Any issues with charging?  I have to restart over and over to get the thing to charge
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Valor pls review the spark 30c
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Do both of them have headphone jacks?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Can you make a video about a54 5g
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Watching on Samsung A15 5g
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,How much is the A15 4g current price
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"I just bought the A15 5G at Target for $75, but I haven't opened or activated it yet and can return it.  Should I keep it, or should I return it and buy the A16 5G for $150?"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Will I be able to play codm for 2 years or longer with it with smooth gameplay?
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,How do you get action photos to not be blurry? All of my children's photos are blurry bc they are never still
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"There is a small problem with the screen when I put a protective screen and I play with 4 must the keys lag and do not respond I changed the protective screen twice always the same problem has anyone else had this problem, thank you."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Bro I love you and your videos. I am currently using the A15 5g version and I can tell you that the bezels are not really an issue. You get used to them over time .

P.S. I love your outro song"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Me watching from a  iPhone 15 plus bc I’m wanting to add this phone to my collection
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Some people like the clicky home button
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Na budget phone wey go fit run CODM i find reach here 😂
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Can it compete with redmi 13c 4g and 5g
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,❤❤❤❤
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Compare Galaxy a05s vs a15
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Will do Samsung a15 4G working Thailand
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Pls sir redmi 14c vs tecno spark 30c

Pls sir"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Worst, most frustrating phone I've ever owned. While the hardware is OK, (except for application memory management limitations) the OS user format interface is exceptionally poor. Especially anything text related.  Keyboard format, emoji settings arbitrarily alter; forcing unwanted animations; screen capture ends up interacting with apps or just swiping screen panel; voice to text is NOT intuitive,  it arbitrarily changes to message recording rather than dictaion.
I can only run a few simple apps at a time before the system crashes apps (yes cache is regularly cleared) as though it's out of RAM.
It seems to push updates almost weekly and each time it alters settings; often adding ""features"" that botch up the format I was just getting used to. Further, each ""update"" seems to degrade performance further.
I've had this phone 3 months and regret buying/using it. If possible,  I would rate it 0."
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,👍👍👍
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,HI pleasee has anyone bought the phone recently......i would like to know the price specifically  d 4G
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Im watching this video on the A15 5G and for some reason it runs HORRIBLE.  When i try turn my phone off the bottom half of the screen turns black and the top half  goes sideways (sometimes) the input delay is like 7 seconds and it lags out when i try and open apps.  And sometimes my keyboard dissapears and i cant get i back for like half an hour. Lol
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Photo color is slightly different - lighter on 4G.
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I just got mine and it's not clicky😅
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,This phone's operating system has a lot of glitches and I will not recommend it
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,My former phone
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,I should have just bought the a15 4g instead of the fucking 5g cuz I don’t see any difference
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Charging erly down😢
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"Samsung, network issue is always on"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"5g camera better
4g version looks blurry and yellow"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,"This phone sucks. Apparently I guess it's use is best for old ppl bc I've had it for a year it sucks. I miss my 11 pro max. This phone is so slow, bugs out, cannot run snapchat properly, or SoundCloud and I am absolutely sick of it"
6KaUzjZ3-Sg,Give one please even you submerged
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Reserve The New Galaxy Devices (Get $50 off) ➡ https://howl.link/bti56ju9nx925
What are your thoughts on the A15 5G? Thanks for watching!"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I ordered mine off of HSN for $100.  It comes with tracfone service, but after I use it up I am going to by a sim card for another carrier. Honestly, I had the Samsung A13 for 2 years and loved it.  I just needed a little more storage and this phone fits my needs perfectly."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I ordered one for $152 and its crazy to think cheap phones are THIS good already. 
I'm going to use it for banking and security apps mostly so the 4-5 years of software support is a big plus to me."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I bought a15 5g at 20k INR in navy blue 
This is good and giving good battery life and not heat when gaming but warm😢 
It's is samsung best seeling a series phone in 2023"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I Switched From An Iphone 12 , Was A Bit Skeptical At First But This Phone Is Amazing , Battery Life , Storage , Customization Options Top Notch ! Will Not Be Purchasing Apple Again !"
6NBH0KLLe9s,I wanted to get the s54 but the cricket store was out of stock so I ended up getting an a15 and I have to say I've been quite pleased with it. It's not the fastest thing on the planet but it is a MASSIVE upgrade from the galaxy a10e I've been using for the past 5 years. I'm not a fan of switching phones every year or two and this phone does everything I want much better than my old phone so I don't  feel too bad about missing out on the more souped up s54.
6NBH0KLLe9s,2:20 glad Samsung is still keeping the headphone jack on the A Series phone! But it’s completely gone from the S Series phones
6NBH0KLLe9s,This Samsung Galaxy A15 5G Because I Love It ❤
6NBH0KLLe9s,Just ordered one of these - will report back on experience - BUT - based on reports.... for the price... pretty sure I'll be very happy.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"This is the phone that I really want for just making phone calls, googling, whatsapp'ing and nothing more. Not in a million years should I spend 1.9K for a foldable Z phone just to break after a couple years."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"The ram management example was very helpful, thank you."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I got this phone. It's awesome.
6NBH0KLLe9s,3:57 According to Samsung this screen has the same tech they putted on the S23 : Vision Booster. And i love it.
6NBH0KLLe9s,I switched from iphone 12 Mini and I'm really happy. Great budget device
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Been an apple fanboy my whole life, had every iphone up to the 14 pro max. Broke my pro max and didnt wanna spend a shit ton on a new one. Went and picked this phone up and absolutely love it. I won't be going back to apple."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I find it funny that all the smartphone reviews never do a segment on how the phone does on making phone calls and how it sounds when talking to someone. Its all about playing stupid games and taking pictures and crap like that,instead of whata phone is used for, to make a phone call..."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I have the prepaid version of the samsung a15 5g and it's been an extremely good phone so far.
6NBH0KLLe9s,I just got mine yesterday ♥️
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice it has headphone jack
6NBH0KLLe9s,Excellent review!
6NBH0KLLe9s,This looks great in every area except performance. Crazy the mediatek dimensity 700 chip in the a13 and a14 5g was a more solid performing chipset. I can't help but think a more reliable snapdragon chip would've been much better.
6NBH0KLLe9s,The 90 Hz refresh rate can be turned on or off during the set up process but the phone warns you that if you do set it up it will drain the battery  faster
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thanks for making the review.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Using the Samsung A15 along side my iPhone XS and I am content 😊
6NBH0KLLe9s,Hey Shane great wee video as always I have used the Samsung Galaxy A13 I thought that it was a very good phone I'am currently using the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G phone it's better than the Samsung Galaxy A13 phone but I'am thinking about getting the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G some time real soon.
6NBH0KLLe9s,this was a really in depth review and it is very informative thank you so much:)
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thanks alot for this great video,it really helped.I've ordered mine should get it next week."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I do find it sluggish but my biggest beef with it is it doesn't play android auto on all the vehicles I drive. It just crashes, and the screen on the vehicle is frozen or just black.
If you have any advice on why it would be appreciated 👍"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Make a video about Samsung A35.. PLEASE .
6NBH0KLLe9s,S24 ULTRA 3 months review please we need that 🙏
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I went to a phone store today to check out the 2024 Samsung Galaxy A15 5G.
I opened up six apps on the phone numerous times. I went back to the home screen and then to the close apps button. Each time I tapped on an open app it opened right up, it did not close.
I did this numerous times.
The phone that you are using must have a software issue."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I applaud Samsung for the Sd card and headphone jack
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Like what mkbhd said: cheap phones are getting good,good phones are not getting cheap
this a15 is an example of a cheap phone,4yrs ago the a10s was pretty good now this a15 is real good i  will buy this when its at its lowest price"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not really major"
6NBH0KLLe9s,That was a nice little blade you used to open the box
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I still have my Samsung Galaxy M21 from 2020, dropped it in a puddle & it's still going strong lol. So I'm all for Samsung Galaxy phones. Thank you for reassuring me that upgrading to this model is a good idea, as a lot of the updated apps aren't compatible with android system 12 software & network changing to only 5g network."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thank you for covering the screen brightness - an often overlooked feature in the vast majority of phone reviews. My job has me working outside and I have to make and receive work-related calls and texts. My current phone (Moto G22) is pitiful in the sunlight, and that's at maximum full brightness. This has been very helpful."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Not a bad phone for the price. Btw you're really cute 😍
6NBH0KLLe9s,samsung galaxy a15 లో .sachivalayam employee కి అవసరం అయ్యి. ఎటెండెన్స్ కి సంబందించిన. ఆధార్ ఫేస్ అప్  instal అవ్వడం లేదు .ఇ అప్ ఇన్స్టాల్ అవ్వద్దు అని samsung వాళ్ళు  చెప్పారు .దీని వలనా నేను చాలా ఇబ్బంది పడుతున్నాను. దయచేసి పరిష్కరం దొరుకుతుందా
6NBH0KLLe9s,"My a20 5g dies so quick i needed this. Just got the yellow one for 127 plus tax 137! But 4g. Cant wait, comes in next Tuesday ill update everyone.👍"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice I'm going to buy one
6NBH0KLLe9s,I just ordered 2 of these phones. Thanks for the review...I had an old lg aristo 3 and it died. I don't even think they make phones anymore. Well I think this should be a big upgrade compared to that. I also got one for my son who is turning 18 for his bday. He has an older galaxy so I'm hoping these phone last awhile. Looks good from your review. 😊
6NBH0KLLe9s,I love the Samsung Galaxy a15 5g
6NBH0KLLe9s,"A brand new A15 G5 6GB International on ""sale"", you can find for $179 CAD / $130 USD. Same phone every day for $199 CAD / 145 US. It's good for what you get."
6NBH0KLLe9s,The video are stable are you using a stand or with your hands or how did you make them that stable ?
6NBH0KLLe9s,I.own the Samsung A15 4G 128GB phone. Fir editing my travel photography on. I put a 512GB SD Card inside it.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thanks. I have the A14. I like it except for the camera at times. HSN has a 2 pack of the A15 on sale today for only $109.99
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Unless you can get your hands on the international 8gb of ram, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE so many issues after a few months of use. I understand it's cheap but for 200 dollars I did not expect an unusable phone"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice explain
6NBH0KLLe9s,I got mine before yesterday
6NBH0KLLe9s,wont those camera lenses get scratched over time?? or are they immune to scratches from day to day use...?
6NBH0KLLe9s,"This is 130€, where a iPhone 15 plus is 1119€, almost 10x as much. You can barely tell the difference, seriously. Both premium feel, with some shitty software and screen candy overdose messing up, except that Samsung/Google allows a bit more tweaking and sideloading and comes with a SD slot for near free storage updates and a mini-jack. I bet they roughly cost the same to manufacture, Apple can use slightly better quality components thanks to their production volume, but it is splitting hairs, so that means Apple gobbles up 800€ pure profit if you compare excl. VAT prices."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Guys my mom has the same exact phone the phone irl looks like an iPhone but with straight cameras and it's cool charges really fast too I SUGGEST THIS PHONE!!❤
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Hey great review which games did you play ""football game"" name please share"
6NBH0KLLe9s,dont say youll do a real time test then make 5 edits it ruined any credibility in the test
6NBH0KLLe9s,Watching  from galaxy
6NBH0KLLe9s,The drawback for Europe is you can't use a universal e-SIM card. Only physical SIM cards work in this.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thank you
6NBH0KLLe9s,just got one for 136.99 so I'm sure theyll keep going down more and more affordable.
6NBH0KLLe9s,How exactly do you charge it with a C to C cord?  Sorry but I'm behind the times on this stuff.
6NBH0KLLe9s,I'm going to get this phone soon and I know this is a stupid question but does this phone have a ear piece speaker above the front camera so you can hear the person on the other end of the call?
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Just got this phone through AT&T carrier, but having trouble getting the wifi calling to engage  !"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Mine cost $380 wtf.  I got ripped off.  I did keep the same number and she gave me a screen protector, case and USB connector  but why was it so expensive?"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Great for the money. I won't be buying anything other then budget now. They are so good now😊
6NBH0KLLe9s,"It has the basic features: nfc, smartview, 5g"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Did you say it is 4GB RAM??
6NBH0KLLe9s,Can you use a 35w adapter for the A15?

6NBH0KLLe9s,Why is the power button finger print sensor button flat vs the volume buttons.  Drives me nuts
6NBH0KLLe9s,does it have built in screen recorder?
6NBH0KLLe9s,at least a55 performance is enough for somebody like me
6NBH0KLLe9s,the cross apps does get annoying. does the samsung fe phones do that aswell??
6NBH0KLLe9s,where u get the controller
6NBH0KLLe9s,Me watching on the a13
6NBH0KLLe9s,I'm looking for a new phone becasue the Samsung Galaxy A12 I bought over 2 years ago has the wrong serial number and doesn't have NFC enabled.  I contact Samsung and they told me after I gave them the IMEI number. I also found out it was meant to be sold in Malayasia not the UK!!  Who knew??
6NBH0KLLe9s,I want this coming from a s23 ultra to A15 on battery 🔋 life and light weight i feel like flagship and the high end is over rated the cheap A series are catching up in quality
6NBH0KLLe9s,Has this phone reached Uganda en where can I get it

6NBH0KLLe9s,can I keep mine on charger with out it ruining the battrey
6NBH0KLLe9s,4gb ram is enough?
6NBH0KLLe9s,Might look into the a35. Play pokemon go and monster hunter now alot and the 4GB ram in my a14 5G starting to become a problem. Music apps i try to use at the same time keeps cutting out due to the games eating up all of the available ram 🐏
6NBH0KLLe9s,I think the A15 also has an 256gb 8 ram version
6NBH0KLLe9s,Will stay wth my galaxy z fold 5 not that big
6NBH0KLLe9s,I hate my A15 5G. I catch myself saying out loud I hate this f****** phone every day. Slow as hell. Laggy as fuck. Types by itself. Sucks the big one.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Today l received mine from there

6NBH0KLLe9s,"It's a good device,  but the camera and video quality is so bad,  even my old galaxy A31 was far far better in everything. I'm not very excited about purchasing A15, I barely take a photo or video because of the low quality"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"The phone is the same , but it's color blue"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Honestly I boight my 15 pro max and the shopkeeper said he will give me a discount for just $115 and seriously it looks like an iPhone 14. Looks good feels good and I used it more than my 15 Pro max or 13 Pro max or 13 Pro max

6NBH0KLLe9s,Samsung couldn't do expandable storage for thr s24 ultra ong seething
