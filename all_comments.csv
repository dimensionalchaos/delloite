fFCGtAmse5c,I upgraded to this phone from my Samsung A11❤  It's so good alongside with my Tab A9 Plus!
fFCGtAmse5c,"Yes, I did purposely make this video 15 minutes long *(A15)* My A55 unboxing next week will be 55 minutes long 👀

A15 5G via Amazon: https://geni.us/A15-5g
A15 4G/LTE  via Amazon: https://geni.us/A15-4G-LTE
microSD Card: https://geni.us/EVO-microSD"
fFCGtAmse5c,I love the fact that you are always so honest when reviewing phones.
fFCGtAmse5c,there is a secondary speaker you couldn't do phone calls without it. But its not configured as stereo speakers.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Cracked my A13 screen. So im buying this one, hopefully i will be impressed"
fFCGtAmse5c,Im getting this soon
fFCGtAmse5c,Im getting this phone next week
fFCGtAmse5c,Is this phone for recording videos?
fFCGtAmse5c,"Ive come to the realization that the A1 series of phones are usually begind about 5 years on Camera quality in relation to the flagship lineup... The camera in the A15 is pretty much equal to the camera in the Galaxy S10 phones. The A0 phones are about 7 years behind. With the A05S being level with the S7 or S8 phones. The A2 are about 3 years behind, A3s are about 2-3 years behind, and the A5s are only 1-2 years behind."
fFCGtAmse5c,My new mobile
fFCGtAmse5c,these are on sale at walmart 89.99 cut down to 69.99 for the 4GB / 64GB version. I picked one up for my dad. Poor guy was using a old chinese ZTE that wont even support google anymore.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Is a Samsung Galaxy A24 4G still a better buy than this ??? 
Btw..my Samsung A71 speaker sounds the same as this new A15 …😂."
fFCGtAmse5c,"So the price of this phone varies a lot, it can be $100, 150, or absolutely free with new line purchase depending on carrier. Let's go based off Samsung's asking price of $200. My gripe with that is, for only $50 more, you can buy a used / refurbished A54 for around $250. 120 hz 1000nits IP67 better cameras better processor better build, only $50 more.

If you're hard pressed against used, then I guess this isn't a bad choice. But I'd still might lean towards the A25 cause it supports stereo sound, 120hz, and has Exynos chipset (Not as good as Snapdragon but not a budget cut chip)."
fFCGtAmse5c,Do a15 have Samsung notes that is for me imported for me
fFCGtAmse5c,I AM watching on iPhone 12 mini 😅
fFCGtAmse5c,Samsung a15 5g is cool .

fFCGtAmse5c,Sir can u thow some light on poor gaming experience reviews. I ve already ordered for my son at 9th grade. I am concerned he may tell me to take his advice 1st. I am a lay man in tech sense. All i thought was a latest 2024 model n i went for it.

1C2vu1LSsok,Thank you so much. Consumer cellular kept telling my dad he had to let us die before they could fix it. It would’ve took months for it to do that.

iP0QW7WEyr0,Watching from galaxy a15 5g
iP0QW7WEyr0,One thing I noticed is; the widgets on the bottom corners of your lock screen can be changed or removed. Hold down on the lock screen and you will have the option to customize them. I removed the left one and set the right one to turn on and off my flashlight without unlocking the phone.
iP0QW7WEyr0,Good video bro but has anyone had screen delay freeze or so ...or its just bc screen protection glass?it happend to me every time i use to play a game?
iP0QW7WEyr0,Best phone I've ever had. Glad I purchased it
iP0QW7WEyr0,RAM+ in my experience makes my A53 5G laggy so I turned it off. My biggest gripe with Samsung is Samsung keeps installing apps on my phone I can't uninstall.
iP0QW7WEyr0,Great phone overall😊
iP0QW7WEyr0,First 5G smartphone I've ever owned and the best to.
iP0QW7WEyr0,Saw it free on boost so i grabbed it today.
iP0QW7WEyr0,"It might be stupid but, when im in an app and i hit the home button and go to  another app for a moment and then either open up my recently used apps or hit the home button and go back go the app i was using it reloaded my entire progress, as if i (where filling out an application or retrieving a security code from my email) it reboots me to the beginning of the app or progress is lost from what i was doing..."
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thank you
iP0QW7WEyr0,Another cool feature is the split screen
iP0QW7WEyr0,How guest mode active plz suggest me
iP0QW7WEyr0,this phone has given me more issues than any other phone i have had.
iP0QW7WEyr0,Split screen is the most unmentioned important thing
iP0QW7WEyr0,هل يوجد تطبيق كاميرا يحسن شاشة الكاميرا الامامية السيلفي لم اقتنع بها للاسف 😔
iP0QW7WEyr0,How do you get the blue look
iP0QW7WEyr0,Is there any way to receive texts with the mobile data turned off?  I don't have unlimited data and have never had a phone that won't get texts with it off before.
iP0QW7WEyr0,What about screen record
iP0QW7WEyr0,I don't know how to swipe for screenshot
iP0QW7WEyr0,I got that color.
iP0QW7WEyr0,Watching from galaxya04e
iP0QW7WEyr0,"How do you ""switch to basic"" BEFORE you wake up????"

iP0QW7WEyr0,You don't mention a lot of things in this
iP0QW7WEyr0,Why I cant do live he stop the live instantly
iP0QW7WEyr0,Still has not seen how to record call on my a15 Samsung phone. Am very disappointed paa
iP0QW7WEyr0,My a15 is 8gb ram
iP0QW7WEyr0,did I SEE PUBGG ??? bro come 1v1
iP0QW7WEyr0,Sucka theres no native screen record application.
iP0QW7WEyr0,This phone is trash smh...I hate it hands down the worst galaxy I've ever owned ....this junk can't even crop pics without downloading an app
iP0QW7WEyr0,What about screen record
iP0QW7WEyr0,Watching from A15 5g
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have been using it for 2 months. It's enough for most people.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review. This A15 5G looks identical to my A25, but I am glad I bought the latter, the extra 50 bucks price difference seems to be worth it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got my Galaxy phone....loving it so far...
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching with my newly purchased Galaxy A15. 
I have both an Iphone and this, but I prefer to use this 🥰"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought it today as a toy for my daughter. I got it brand new for $40 from walmart. It is locked to straighttalk. But who cares I am not putting a sim in it, as it is going to be used as a gaming phone by kids."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"i got this to replace my redmi 8 pro as the battery was dying. great phone, feels solid, camera is not as good as only 30fps but that doesnt bother me. has all the bells and whisltles like NFC. cant fault it for a £100 phone ❤"

MP-aGSJJsvk,i have this phone 6gb ram... I love it. huge performance difference compared to 4gb
MP-aGSJJsvk,This is my current phone. I went from the galaxy a24 fir 4 years with only 32 gigs so now having 128 gigs feels insane to me i can axtually download apps and take pictures again 🤣
MP-aGSJJsvk,"for 100 bucks it does the job, has a nice screen and is passible for a fill in phone"
MP-aGSJJsvk,is it good for gaming?

MP-aGSJJsvk,"The flashlight doesn't work when I'm taking pics using the back camera it's only works on the front camera, please assist"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I love samsug phons😘
MP-aGSJJsvk,Great phone but it will be supported for 2y's and 11 months more so why would I buy it...
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does it have a delay when typing? Or when selecting anything on the screen
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thicc bezels😢
MP-aGSJJsvk,Its a replica of Galaxy A50 of 2019 model. Just processor changed..😂

SuIl1KRWhSc,Surveillance camera quality 😂
SuIl1KRWhSc,Tear drop notches should be banned already
SuIl1KRWhSc,my old 2012 mobile is blazing faster than this pile of shit. Samsung should remove ita logo for their best m seriously. I have never had worse mobile than this wanna be Mr expensive lookie phone. I would easily pay more for a 2015 mobile than paying 200 bucks for this shit. i couldn't even complete important bank job.

iso6qgCo6vI,I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy. I am a senior citizen and this video was very informative. I thank you very much. I will be watching more of your videos.
iso6qgCo6vI,"How to make a call at 24:02!  So many of these ""basic"" videos assume we already know that.  I'm 78  and this is my first cell phone of any kind.  As AT&T cut my landline off I was home alone with no way to call 911 in an emergency.  Now I can!  Thank you!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"This video for the phone I just bought was a life saver!  Am elderly and very tech challenged!  Tried the first video by someone else and immediately turned it off.  Then I found your video.  Easy to understand and pause, as needed.  I highly recommend this video.  Liked and subscribed.  Going to watch all of your videos that pertain to my Samsung Galaxy 15.  Was seriously about to turn in and pay the restocking fee to get rid of the phone.  With your help, am going to be able to maneuver the phone and do everything I need to do!  Thank you so much!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"After updating from a phone that was 7-9 years old, this was very valuable. Well presented !"
iso6qgCo6vI,"This video was well explained. Just got this phone, so I am starting from scratch, from a Flip Phone. Big difference  with so much to learn."
iso6qgCo6vI,great video can't figure out how to set up voicemail
iso6qgCo6vI,"Mate - I'm only half way through this video.... THANK YOU!!!! Great guidance. I have friends who ""clicki de click - clack - its fixed!"" but thats not the same as learning for yourself. Thanks, fella. this video sorted out a lot of problems."
iso6qgCo6vI,Hey thanks a lot for this video. I haven’t used Android in many years and this is such a help.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for providing such clear instructions!  You now have a new subscriber, one who is truly a dinosaur in the age of technology!"
iso6qgCo6vI,I like the way you teach and model step by step the navigation process on the phone. It was very helpful so that I can show it to my beginning cell buyers and they need to know basically the fundamentals and navigation of using a cell phone.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Absolutely brilliant! Superb explanations and demonstrations of the buttons and their use. Easy to understand and so, so helpful Thank you for taking the time and trouble to post."
iso6qgCo6vI,Bought one a few days ago and the battery 🔋 quality is good I just installed a 256 sd card to transfer my apps and files on the card i heard about the A16 doesn't have a headset jack but you can get one online and it available at 5 below
iso6qgCo6vI,i learned a lot of tricks with this video thanks a lot
iso6qgCo6vI,Very well presented. thank you.
iso6qgCo6vI,I liked this video! This video helped me a lot. Thanks! ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so much. I was having an anxiety attack! I would like my phone to do a better job of voice to text. Also my new phone send a second text, a duplicate of the first text?"
iso6qgCo6vI,EXCELLENT tutorial. THX!
iso6qgCo6vI,Fantastic presentation; thanks so much for taking the time to post this.
iso6qgCo6vI,It actually worked ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Very well explained video love your video. I am planning to get this phone. I would like more videos on this phone on how to get wifi with the passwords. Or can I use my data if i don't have the wifi. I have no internet at home. Please respond on the video on this A15 5G Samsung Galaxy awaiting your videos
iso6qgCo6vI,"When I'm watching a video, on my A15, how do you reduce the size of video? (Smaller screen)"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thanks great video. But i dont get the three dots on bottom of home screen.
iso6qgCo6vI,Need to learm how take smap shot on a andriod phone
iso6qgCo6vI,The button the left won't show the apps I have open I hit it and nothing happens
iso6qgCo6vI,My screen doesn't look like this.   I have no home screen button when at the web browser
iso6qgCo6vI,"I realized pretty quick why this phone is $200 , no wireless charging! no power plug included?! ridiculous! But if you're on a tight budget its a decent phone."
iso6qgCo6vI,You didn't show how to set up a voicemail

VDwxEagh188,"I swapped my old Iphone 7 plus to this. I only add Php3000. 
I love it."
VDwxEagh188,"Loving my a15 5g. Seems to be a little bit slower than my a14 5g,but not a big deal considering all that is on this phone. The size and design fits my hand so much better than the a14 5g."
VDwxEagh188,My biggest complaint is no wireless charging especially with all of the modern day technology.
VDwxEagh188,"You just earned yourself a new subscriber.

I love your honest review.

Can this Phone do Front and Back video recording at same time?"
VDwxEagh188,This device is kinda like the J7 or J7 prime on steroids!!!!!
VDwxEagh188,"I recently saw one of these Samsung A15 5g phones in my local Walmart and I was impressed with this screen quality and the build too.  How would you say performance in regards to multitasking holds up?  Also, do those matte screen protectors make a difference with the phone out in direct sunlight?  I enjoy content on the budget devices to see what they’re capable of, keep up the great content!"
VDwxEagh188,"I am buy this phone tomorrow, if they use the virtual ram for background processes and the physical ram is not being used for that then its already good. N1 killer on smartphones are the background apps running. If you have a LCD screen like me and going to super Amoled, then the screen is going to be God tier and it has a good camera for me coming from a Nokia G20. The Nokia G20 that I have has sometimes artifacting in the instagram and youtube shorts, can't watch 720p 60fps video without lagging and on some objects the camera does not focus. Nokia G20 is not a bad phone, it's software is not good. I don't blame the hardware, but I always blame the software."
VDwxEagh188,I bought mine 6 months ago and now the screen has frozen and I can't use it?
VDwxEagh188,Planned obsolescence just like that every other phone without a user replaceable battery.
VDwxEagh188,please show me your case name and where to buy it. Thank you!
VDwxEagh188,Could you please name the case you are using again I'm unable to find it. I need that case. 😁🇬🇧👍

o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you for the video. Great work as always!!!
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got it for my birthday yesterday
o6yNybwt0hM,Is it better than the moto g stylus 5g 2023?
o6yNybwt0hM,My mom is wanting to get me a new phone before I leave for college I don't need much so this one seems good for my needs thanks for the detailed review!! Personally I like the teardrop cameras but that's just a matter of taste ofc.
o6yNybwt0hM,As of today I actually got this phone at Walmart for 66$ with tax included. Not a bad rig for the price as a straight talk phone
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks for testing 💋🤩
o6yNybwt0hM,"As of Nov 22, 2024, Amazon has this phone at $115, 'refurbished'(Excellent condition). Just bought one and will try it with Mint mobile. Can you believe Deadpool has a phone company🤯"
o6yNybwt0hM,Any way to get rid of the freezing and lag with this phone?? Having really bad issues with this one.
o6yNybwt0hM,There's samsung a15 on ebay that has 64gb instead of 128gb is the other upgrades the same?
o6yNybwt0hM,As a year experieced using this phone already. I don't recommended buying it. Too hot+unresponsive touchscreen  and touchscreen don't work well😢. 8GB ram+bad cpu+heat it resulted in slow device.
o6yNybwt0hM,I can get that phone at Walmart for $139 (locked to AT&T though). And A14 for $69. Really great price for the phones! They are prepaid. But I can swap out my sim to these. And works fine
o6yNybwt0hM,What about the phone's speaker? I hear the speaker is bad.
o6yNybwt0hM,Does Live FM radio work with this phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,"j'ai rendu ce model au bout de 3h00 !    pas de corbeillemessage !  clavier lettre chiffre trop petit et paramètre clavier a fuir !
quand a leur application que ont peut désactiver et qui ce réactive a votre insu, alors a fuir !  
j'ai voulu entre le code de validation pour accéder au plystore.. impossible d'avoir le clavier simple avec minuscule/majuscule. 
donc retour a l'achat."
o6yNybwt0hM,The back panel will come apart from over heating the back panel will come un glued!!!!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 3:56
o6yNybwt0hM,Is the Samsung a15 5g better than the Samsung a32 5g? Im still using the A32 5g
o6yNybwt0hM,"Please say 
Samsung galaxy a15 is good gaming isn't it"
o6yNybwt0hM,It won't sync with my 2019 Ford Ranger. Why?
o6yNybwt0hM,Did you say bc boarder control the price is what it is
o6yNybwt0hM,"Not that ugly,May God Bless"
o6yNybwt0hM,Someone connected to visible or verizon?
o6yNybwt0hM,Has network issues
o6yNybwt0hM,I'm watching this video on my Samsung Galaxy A15 5G
o6yNybwt0hM,"$69 @ Walmart for AT&T prepaid, can't beat it!"
o6yNybwt0hM,Can't believe you people are lying about this phone beign decent to good prolly get paid for those false comments lol.this is the worse phone on the market right now in my opinion thin
o6yNybwt0hM,There is no worse than this. I never been so frustrated wjth a phone in my life.
o6yNybwt0hM,M34
o6yNybwt0hM,If you like to take selfies.  Stay away from this phone.  Camera is awful.  Taking screenshots is another issue.  I'm sorry i purchased this phone.
o6yNybwt0hM,TRASH PHONE JUST RETURNED. Worst camera everrr

6NBH0KLLe9s,"Reserve The New Galaxy Devices (Get $50 off) ➡ https://howl.link/bti56ju9nx925
What are your thoughts on the A15 5G? Thanks for watching!"
6NBH0KLLe9s,I wanted to get the s54 but the cricket store was out of stock so I ended up getting an a15 and I have to say I've been quite pleased with it. It's not the fastest thing on the planet but it is a MASSIVE upgrade from the galaxy a10e I've been using for the past 5 years. I'm not a fan of switching phones every year or two and this phone does everything I want much better than my old phone so I don't  feel too bad about missing out on the more souped up s54.
6NBH0KLLe9s,I got this phone. It's awesome.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I find it funny that all the smartphone reviews never do a segment on how the phone does on making phone calls and how it sounds when talking to someone. Its all about playing stupid games and taking pictures and crap like that,instead of whata phone is used for, to make a phone call..."
6NBH0KLLe9s,This looks great in every area except performance. Crazy the mediatek dimensity 700 chip in the a13 and a14 5g was a more solid performing chipset. I can't help but think a more reliable snapdragon chip would've been much better.
6NBH0KLLe9s,3:57 According to Samsung this screen has the same tech they putted on the S23 : Vision Booster. And i love it.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Excellent review!
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thank you for covering the screen brightness - an often overlooked feature in the vast majority of phone reviews. My job has me working outside and I have to make and receive work-related calls and texts. My current phone (Moto G22) is pitiful in the sunlight, and that's at maximum full brightness. This has been very helpful."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I love the Samsung Galaxy a15 5g
6NBH0KLLe9s,I.own the Samsung A15 4G 128GB phone. Fir editing my travel photography on. I put a 512GB SD Card inside it.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thank you
6NBH0KLLe9s,Gaming chapter my fav but tell me about its camera 📸
6NBH0KLLe9s,dont say youll do a real time test then make 5 edits it ruined any credibility in the test
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I have this celphone and base from my experience, one of bad celphone purchase"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Great for the money. I won't be buying anything other then budget now. They are so good now😊
6NBH0KLLe9s,does it have built in screen recorder?
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Ill buy it just because i see you've got the bible app, won me over !"
6NBH0KLLe9s,M15 is better
MN0qF-mAAyo,Merci. very helpful 🇭🇹🎀🌻🍒
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine today on the samsung publicity video it says use smart switch to transfer your applications from another samsung phone, my new A 15 5g didn't have it and it took over an hour to install it,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Thank you for this !!
MN0qF-mAAyo,I would like to see if I can get separate ringtones for text and notifications.
MN0qF-mAAyo,I LOVE HIS VOICE
MN0qF-mAAyo,How to copy files to the data folder
MN0qF-mAAyo,"yeah, @1:05 pretty insane? yes you think my now and years past, they could mount camera lens in the middle!!!!!!!. still decent phone,, too smooth yet still erratic. If I can get the speaker updated. The EQ presets done come close to what the speaker outputs.  It sound just like the sound comes out a square piece of tin,,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Taken me days to sort out the camera and sound configuration after they went wrong. The phone (it’s a phone!) has too many technical features. Ok, It was bought in 2024 while my other phones are older and much easier to use."
MN0qF-mAAyo,I Did not find this as  basic as  I  needed.   Never having had a Samsung phone before.   Plus I found you spoke too fast.
MN0qF-mAAyo,Unlock device have forgot'n password
MN0qF-mAAyo,R u for real u r teaching us how to install sim card and how to wake up phone and the signal what did u smoke😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
