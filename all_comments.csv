XaqOejIaFgM,7 years security update and 7 years OS upgrade is value for money in itself. Weldone Samsung.
XaqOejIaFgM,"My S20 is 4 years old and it's still getting monthly security updates, I've always respected that."
XaqOejIaFgM,"Not that you’re ever overly negative in your reviews but I think this is the most glowing review I’ve seen you make over the years. You seem legitimately satisfied, even a little giddy about the refinements, without going over the top. I’m excited for this device"
XaqOejIaFgM,Whose here after the awful s25 launch
XaqOejIaFgM,I've got mine ordered. Going from an S8+ to the S24 Ultra. Big jump.
XaqOejIaFgM,Biggest improvement : SCRATCHES AT LEVEL 7 WITH DEEPER GROOVES AT LEVEL 8!!!
XaqOejIaFgM,"This is probably the first phone review from MKBHD I've watched, where he doesn't mention anything he doesn't like about the phone. This phone is great!!"
XaqOejIaFgM,Here after shitty iPhone 16 launch. Been an apple user since iPhone 6 but switched 3 days ago. Highly satisfied.
XaqOejIaFgM,"As a pixel user, I was really fascinated Google did so much for them with the AI stuff. Would love a full video on that"
XaqOejIaFgM,"00:40 - Intro
1:19 - Screen & Screenlock
2:40 - Battery
3:30 - Performance & S-Pen
5:08 - Camera 
8:30 - Software & AI features (in partnership with Google)
14:45 - Comparison to iPhone 15 Pro Max
16:25 -  What's missing? And Summary

We're all gonna make it, brahs."
XaqOejIaFgM,From the s9+ to the s24 ultra. This upgrade is sheer love!
XaqOejIaFgM,"Really appreciate your videos, no over the top yelling for attention with quick edits or music blaring in the background,  just straight forward, calm reviews of products. Perfect."
XaqOejIaFgM,Whose here after the awful iphone  16 launch
XaqOejIaFgM,I'm glad to see that Samsung is stepping up their game with the security updates and OS upgrades. It's important for long-term value and user experience. Well done!
XaqOejIaFgM,"A year goes by so fast, if I can't get 5 years out of the phone something's wrong"
XaqOejIaFgM,Man hearing Marques give such an overwhelmingly positive review of a Samsung phone feels like a rarity. Glad i waited for this phone! Nice review as always!
XaqOejIaFgM,Thanks for the review mate. Just ordered the 24 Ultra. I'm using my phone more and more these days for youtube so it's good to see these camera improvements and also durability 👍
XaqOejIaFgM,"The Samsung S24 Ultra seems like a game-changer with its impressive features and long-term support. Excited to upgrade and experience it myself! Great review as always, Marques!"
XaqOejIaFgM,Who's Here after the S25U launch
XaqOejIaFgM,We all here for MKBHD's opinion
XaqOejIaFgM,Holy crap. This is the first time he didn't say anything bad about Samsung's ultra lineup of phones. Good thing I went ahead and pre-ordered mine and it's getting here today or tomorrow 😊
XaqOejIaFgM,"I switched from iPhones to the s23 Ultra, and just upgraded to the s24 Ultra today. It's amazing. I've never been so satisfied with a phone"
XaqOejIaFgM,Damn that’s crazy you still do phone reviews I used to watch when I was little ‼️I appreciate you
XaqOejIaFgM,In my 8+ years of being your subscriber maybe this is the 1st video where you were praising the product soo much and i loved it all the way.
XaqOejIaFgM,"For me, its the corners. I love the sharp corners of the ultra line. It's so pretty."
XaqOejIaFgM,I came back to this video now that I have finally converted from iphone 14 pro max to the S24 ultra. Not gonna lie this change was worth it. The phone is so stinking good. I'm loving it WAY more then ANY apple i've ever owned. I was apple since the 4.
XaqOejIaFgM,S24 Ultra look more PREMIUM than S25 Ultra...!
XaqOejIaFgM,"You basically just confirmed all the reasons I've been buying the Note and now the S Ultra series phones from Samsung. They're not cheap, but the amount of things on tap that are done either extremely well or well enough that it all adds up being worth the cost to me. Also, as an artist and someone who likes to handwrite, the SPen is incredibly useful and fun. No other phone even has this feature close to this level of refinement so I'd honestly buy the phone just for that if I had to."
XaqOejIaFgM,Absolute monster of a phone.  Mine just arrived mid-January.  Owned Samsung from almost the beginning of Smartphones.  I also always loved windows integration on Android phones that you plug your phone into computer and it shows as a normal extra drive.. still exploring all ai features...
XaqOejIaFgM,9:27 Yes! It would be great if you could give us an analysis of how Google and Samsung are competing against each other and Apple at the same time.
XaqOejIaFgM,"Going back here after watching his video about the best phone of 2024. 
It comes full circle as mentioned in 0:28 that this phone sets the tone for 2024.

I hope my S24U really is going to be my reliable phone for the next 6 years. And I hope yours, too."
XaqOejIaFgM,"I'm not even a phone person, but I keep watching your videos only because MKBHD videos are really really well-presented, with a great personality."
XaqOejIaFgM,Kudos to Samsung for getting rid of curved screen on their ultra model.  Samsung has cone a long way in terms of software.  I recall the touchwiz days. Literally had to flash custom rooms like Cyanogen mods. Only thing I miss from old phones are the removable batteries and expandable storage.
XaqOejIaFgM,I can spend 1300$ on an S24 and iPhone users would still call me broke for preferring an Android.
XaqOejIaFgM,Here after the S25 ultra release looking to grab this
XaqOejIaFgM,Always love watching MKBHD reviews and the different takes he has while tying in a narrative to each review. Would love to hear his take on the relationship between Samsung and Google rn
XaqOejIaFgM,I am here because i want to feel good for the 1300$ i spent
XaqOejIaFgM,"I've had the S8 forever and last night my phone's charging port finally gave up. I got it fixed, but because I was eligible for an upgrade, I bought an S24 Ultra today, largely due to how you meticulously broke down the phone's specs and because of your glowing review. Thanks for the thorough review!"
XaqOejIaFgM,I did it!.... Finally got it 😢
XaqOejIaFgM,"These reviews are genuinely next-level. Great work as always, Marques!"
XaqOejIaFgM,Worth the wait. I hate that other tech reviewers rushed their so called “review” just for the views while taking advantage of the buzz created by Samsung. I like that MKBHD took his time to give us real and quality “review”. There’s levels to this and I can say MKBHD is at the top.
XaqOejIaFgM,Marques just makes every damn phone look so good in every shot. Makes me wanna buy all of them 😂
XaqOejIaFgM,"After watching your new video of the S25U review, I'm considering about getting this one instead lol"
XaqOejIaFgM,"I went from a S10 to the S22 ultra. I've had the S22 for two years and it is still the best phone I have ever experienced. I'll be upgrading to the S24 ultra this year partly because of this review. I TRUST your reviews and I know you're going to be honest, good or bad. Thank you!!"
XaqOejIaFgM,Loved how many sets they used while keeping solid clean audio throughout. 10/10 production.
XaqOejIaFgM,im tired of buying a 1200$ electronic every 3 years...
XaqOejIaFgM,"this phone almost 1 year old and still the best performing phone in the market !! a lot of phones came out after it and they couldnt beat it, respect for samsung"
XaqOejIaFgM,The whole live translation thing is honestly the most impressive bit of technology ive seen in a long time and i love the tech world. Having my phone be able to live translate a conversation im having was something i dreamed of as a kid and saw in spy movies and shows. Crazy that it was just a feature added to galaxy phones with the most recent software update
XaqOejIaFgM,"I love that you change the literal aesthetic of the video when you went to aesthetics section of photography. Production is always on-point, but sometimes I just have to shake my head and smile. Well played, MKBHD, well played..."
XaqOejIaFgM,Ive had my S23+ for a year and i had switched from my iPhone XR. Boy I never see myself switching back. These new Samsung's are absolute beasts!
XaqOejIaFgM,I just got mine today and love it!! Especially love the zoom!! It's unbelievable!
XaqOejIaFgM,One note: the save as sticker feature in Samsung gallery has been available on older phones. I have a galaxy S22 and I've got that feature.
XaqOejIaFgM,"7 years with updates! Well done Samsung! 👏 Phones are so good and expensive now, that it makes sence giving the buyer a reassuring feeling."
XaqOejIaFgM,"I have s24 ultra and iphone 15 pro, and I noticed I like using s24 ultra more, the screen is so great for watching videos and reading ebooks, and the new AR coating is fantastic, it feels like reading a ereader."
XaqOejIaFgM,Just managed to upgrade to s24 ultra today. Glad I made the right decision 😂
XaqOejIaFgM,"One thing I noticed is the battery management is absolutely amazing. Where I would run out 15% of my battery, I now run 1-2% max, it's actually insane...
Yes my S21 Ultra was getting old and I used it A LOT, so the battery would have been losing efficiency. But my god, that's 7x+ on the top end, I don't think i've ever had that experience when i've upgraded, and i've gone
S2 > S4 > S7 Edge > S9 Plus > S21 Ultra > Now this.
Not a single one of those upgrades gave me this battery efficiency."
XaqOejIaFgM,"Thank you for this review, even though I can argue that many people actually like smaller phones at the end of the day.
I have tested the smaller S24 on my channel running the new Exynos, Temps, and Battery drain, and I dare to say that even the base variants this year is impressive, Feel free to check out the numbers for yourself."
XaqOejIaFgM,Was about to pre order the iphone 16 pro max (Had a iphone 15 pro max) watched all the videos on it saw there was minor additions. Started looking into the samsung 24 ultra immediatly bought it. Sold my 15 pro max and my Mac Mini (8gbram  256 storage) at a local mac reseller store for 1300$ cash ordered my samsung online for 999.99 took the profit got a portable monitor 4k 120hz 15.6 in and a full size bluetooth keyboard for Dex. NEVER turning back !
XaqOejIaFgM,"Update on the S24 Ultra vs S25 Ultra

S24 Ultra
- Box Style shape (Just like the original note series)
- S24 Ultra first flat screen with eligant curved frame gives premium style (Flat screen protector frienldy)
- Brightness was tested as ive seen and notice is brighter. (Coating or what not probably causing this but the anti reflection is nearly identical)
- S-Pen bluetooth (Gimick or useful but still very nice knowing you have some inspector gadget type tech in your pocket if needed)
- One UI 7 Update for the S24U has some new video exporting blowing away the non optimized version of the S25 U as seen and tested.
- Camera rings are solid and premium (Flush no potential removal)
- 7 years of update (S24U) and was originally advertised as the AI phone already (I use all the AI features Minus the Now brief on the S25 Ultra i had it turned off)
- S-pen location on the S24 Ultra is in a perfect spot for cases (S25 Ultra seems to have it in a odd location where its curved so all the cases have a nasty open cutout in the corner)

S25 Ultra
- Feels like an Iphone which i always envyed iphone users having a flat square display but the samsung design lost its touch reminds me of the redmagic phone (not Note shape)
- Faster CPU but samsung is behind updating a more optimized version for the S25 Ultra
- Nearly only one year extra of uptades vs the S24 U 
- Extra pixels in one camera (I dont see the difference)
- Blue tooth 5.4 vs 5.3 (Dont notice much maybe the 6.0 will be a bigger upgrade.


Conclusion:
Sending my S25 Ultra back and will continue to use the S24 Ultra (I will snag a new one when they come back to the Note roots i have  under 7 years not in a hurry but ill cross my fingers on this one)"
XaqOejIaFgM,"This phone has all the right boxes ticked out , it's definitely going to be a hit for anyone and everyone who can afford it"
XaqOejIaFgM,moving the car in the photo blew my mind. and that fill in the space. wow!
XaqOejIaFgM,"I am a Pixel 8 Pro user and when S24 dropped and I saw all the AI features,  the first thing I felt was as if this was a Pixel phone on a Samsung Hardware. I was surprised that nobody really mentioned about in the first impression videos! Happy to know that you felt it. Would love to see a video on how Google and Samsung is coming together. Throwback to the Nexus days!"
XaqOejIaFgM,"I'm glad I got the s24 ultra, the s25 ultra losing Bluetooth, not upgrading to a 1 inch sensor for the main cam, not upgrading the 3x telephoto and just the ultrawide lol Samsung got really greedy. if this is the direction Samsung is going, this could be my last Samsung phone the s24 ultra."
XaqOejIaFgM,"I’ve owned iPhones for the last 8yrs, I’m currently on day 2 with my S24 Ultra and I absolutely love it. It’s fantastic."
XaqOejIaFgM,"I've had the S22 Ultra since a few months after it came out, and it's still going strong, but I'm actually compelled to get the 24. One of my favorite things about my S22 Ultra is the zoom on it. I actually just use the view finder like binoculars all the time because the zoom is so insane and stable.
I really thought I could hold off on an upgrade for longer than this, but the S24 Ultra is just so much better, and the flat screen just makes it perfect"
XaqOejIaFgM,The software support and 1TB are my main reasons to get this phone for under $600 with my trade-in.
XaqOejIaFgM,Loving the custom keyboards in the BRoll shots
XaqOejIaFgM,I definitely want a video about those intricacies in colabs between smartphone companies.
XaqOejIaFgM,Got the base S24 two days ago (I had a S20FE before) and am having fun with all the features. The AI autocorrection is especially helpful to me as a non-native English speaker (the feature is also used for this text). And those seven years of updates are tempting.
XaqOejIaFgM,Just got a S24 Ultra...
XaqOejIaFgM,"Just waiting on mine to arrive at Feb 7. I knew this phone was going to be a monster. The new 5x, the 4k120, the 8k on the 5x, the 2600 peak brightness and anti reflective screen makes it easier to shoot outdoors. And also not to mention the shutter lag finally it's gone!! Can't wait!!"
XaqOejIaFgM,"I got mine on Friday and was worried I'd have buyers remorse, but so far I'm so impressed with it. It's very snappy and honestly fun to use."
XaqOejIaFgM,"Very interesting to see that Google and Samsung are collaborating like crazy to build up an unified Android empire to compete with Apple. At this point we might as well call them the Android S24 Ultra, and Android 8 Pro 😂"
XaqOejIaFgM,"I just got this phone, the camera quality alone its just crazy"
XaqOejIaFgM,"Marques, I would love to see you do a separate video on Samsung and google's need for each other. I've always thought this and think it would be great for you to dive into the subject."
XaqOejIaFgM,It’s rare to see you this pleased doing a review.
XaqOejIaFgM,"I dont know about the U.S. 
But here in the UK they're offering all of the following on each purchase:
£100 discount, free upgrade to 512GB, 1yr disney+, 3 months accidental cover, £30 store credit."
XaqOejIaFgM,I'm here to see all that the s25 Ultra can do that was not covered.
XaqOejIaFgM,"It's not often I get to use the same device Marques drops a review on. Got my S24U couple of days back and the other alternative I considered was Pixel 8 pro. I loved the fact that Google and Samsung joined hands on this, especially at the AI on edge computing paradigm we are embarking on now. Phone is incredible, love that the AI features are not in your face but just there. Integrated as if they were always there. Great video as usual and ya, that video on Google+Samsung against the world is worth exploring. And I think this collaboration could go beyond phones as well, like Google TV on Samsung TVs."
XaqOejIaFgM,"My S24 ultra arrived this week, the AI generative fill on photos is insane! I keep trying photos and removing people/objects and it blows my mind each time, even difficult photos where I don't expect it to work, and it does it. Super impressive."
XaqOejIaFgM,The synergy between Google and Samsung is welcome and will make things better for every android consumer. The one thing I would like to see is feature drops on Samsungs like Google does with the Pixels and give more attention to older models. The S23 getting these AI features is a step in the right direction. Another thing everyone seems to overlook about Pixels is that their purpose is also to push other manufacturers to make their OS experience better and simpler for their users. I think this is evident with Samsung's recent One UI updates.
XaqOejIaFgM,I made the switch been on apple for years I got the s24 ultra over the 25 ultra I don't regret it 😊
XaqOejIaFgM,"I ordered the S24+ and am very excited for it. Hobestly price aside, the only things I like more about the Ultra is the 5x telephoto, and the much better Gorilla Glass (anti reflective, and very scratch resistant). Otherwise I'm very excited for the S24+, and prefer the slightly smaller size with rounded corners."
XaqOejIaFgM,Finally back to flat displays. I never liked the curved screens that had inconsistent viewing experiences near the edge. Also THANK YOU SAMSUNG for adding a good anti reflective coating. Most underrated feature.
XaqOejIaFgM,"I got it immediately; after waiting years from the note not being available, to this ""ultra"" being a significantly more expensive upgrade and skipping ANOTHER year, finally pulled the trigger and I effing love it. Black, but all the colors are sweet."
XaqOejIaFgM,"I bought an S9 when it was released. Im writting on that same phone today, have zero problems whatsoever but being an IT maniac, i know this phone will eventually die out. Im looking for the s24ultra or waiting 2 more months for the s25 releases. Cant wait to upgrade. Amazing video."
XaqOejIaFgM,Your reviews hit just right. Very well done as  always. Keep up the great work 😊
XaqOejIaFgM,"I just ordered the 24 ultra… trading in my 13 pro max… I’m really looking forward to the switch, so thank you for helping with my decision"
XaqOejIaFgM,"Still have my s22 ultra, and I love it. Works great. The number of updates  this phone has had since the start is amazing."
XaqOejIaFgM,I'm with Samsung since the note 4 .  Maybe iPhone users don't notice it but there s something on iPhones that no other phone can duplicate . The software response to the touch  . Typing or scrolling down just feels unique .  Small thing but huge difference
XaqOejIaFgM,Did i hear “Jerry Rig Everything” theme music 4:33 !! 😂😂
XaqOejIaFgM,"whenever I purchase a new phone I come here first...for the most thorough, honest and non-biased review.  appreciate you my guy because you let me know features I never knew existed! thank you"
XaqOejIaFgM,The Galaxy S24 Ultra seems to be the go-to for pro users. The fact that it will get SO many OS upgrades makes it a game changer for sure👌🏽
XaqOejIaFgM,"This phone is amazing. I just bought one, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase. I highly recommend it; you won't regret buying this phone."
XaqOejIaFgM,"16:27 Call screening is ALREADY available on samsung devices and has been for over a year now! It can be enabled in the phone app settings. Its called ""bixby Text Call"""
XaqOejIaFgM,"12:58 Marques circled his portrait and expected to have his youtube channel to be popped up but only his hoodie information was listed
- Emotional Damage -"
XaqOejIaFgM,"It doesn't surprise me that every one of your videos is extremely informative to everyone, whether you're a tech guy or just the average person using a phone. You're awesome dude"
XaqOejIaFgM,"why? because the screen is bad, the oleophobic coating wears off within 3 months, because the camera optimization is so bad that it renders anything above standard 12mp completely useless. Becuase the battery is good not great. Because you can get things better or almost equally good for half the price."
XaqOejIaFgM,This is what a genuine user perspective and tech review really is. Well done Mkbhd
XaqOejIaFgM,"I still have S10, works well and I'm using it on daily basis but something about s24 series makes me want to upgrade my smartphone experience 🧐 Thanks for great reviews!"
K-JGaqfIOmI,"The Galaxy S24 Ultra is in many ways a perfect smartphone in 2024. One thing that I would like to see improved in the next iteration is the charging speed on both wired and wireless, which has been stagnant for many years at this point."
K-JGaqfIOmI,I upgraded from Note 10 to s24 not expecting this much of difference but s24 ultra is a beast phone through and through
K-JGaqfIOmI,I have the S23U but I don't feel the need to upgrade because in daily life you really don't notice that much the foto qualities and speed difference. Great review thanks for that! Greetings from the Netherlands!
K-JGaqfIOmI,"👏 for 9.9x picture quality, I totally agree it looks way more attractive to me."
K-JGaqfIOmI,4k 30fps video from main camera was fantastic 😍❤ great details 😊
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Switching from Apple back to Samsung. Apple isn’t a bad phone but I feel it is a scam because everything has to be purchased. Ringtones, Walpapers, games and more. Never had to do this with Samsung !!!"
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Holy shit, Will. Please leave some gains for the rest of us."
K-JGaqfIOmI,"As a Samsung Employee, I can assure you this is best review of S24 Ultra on the Internet."
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Nice review! I rest assured and based on this review I bought the S24Ultra in the yellow colour with 512 GB.
Will get it this week, looking really forward to take pictures with it!
Thanks again😊"
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Love the T shirt, good to see that you've got a sense of humour 👍🏼🤣 Pretty good review too!"
K-JGaqfIOmI,Had the black 512gb s24 Ultra for a month always been a android user since s2. Always liked samsung even when iphone had better features  just always preferred samsung as a phone and will continue but love apple as I purchased ipod and macbook pro as main computers.
K-JGaqfIOmI,bro really got jacked and thought we wouldn't notice.
K-JGaqfIOmI,I just got this Phone three days ago in Titan Violet and i love it
K-JGaqfIOmI,I have been eagerly anticipating this evaluation.
K-JGaqfIOmI,GSMArena really taking the time on this one 👏🏻
K-JGaqfIOmI,I have been using the s24 ultra for weeks. The only thing I can say is this phone is damn good
K-JGaqfIOmI,Excellent and detailed review. Much appreciated  👍.
K-JGaqfIOmI,I got mine and I love it. Came from the Galaxy Note 20. Photo quality was my #1 reason to buy a new phone. 🎉
K-JGaqfIOmI,"To me, if I'm going to pay extra for a phone upgrade, there has to be significant improvement in the camera.  I had both the S24 Ultra and was to trade in my S22 Ultra.   S24 Ultra didn't provide me with significant improvement in the camera, and at long distant shots, it was actually worse.  Shipped it back a few days ago and will be looking for a used S23 Ultra."
K-JGaqfIOmI,Galaxy Note 24 Ultra review let's go.
K-JGaqfIOmI,"I'm actually glad that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra had a flat screen and i don't hate curved displays, but i preferred a flat display.
I wish the S24 Ultra IP68 rating could survive upto 3m of depth of water. And the phone is a bit too pricey. Btw, i hope that next year's S25 Ultra 5x periscope telephoto cam has a 120mm focal length."
K-JGaqfIOmI,2:45 so brightness & display tech isn't mind boggling or anything. It's the standard 750 nits. How's the consistency of that brightness though?
K-JGaqfIOmI,"If u know u love this phone and u can't afford it ,but u hope to buy the S25 ultra, gather here let's cry together 😢"
K-JGaqfIOmI,The intro is another level! Great job 👍
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Hey, I noticed that the 5x zoom with 12 megapixels takes better pictures than when you switch to 5x zoom with 50 megapixels."
K-JGaqfIOmI,I do not think any one person should compare a phone year by year. I think they should be more so past phones like 2 years before considering most people now are holding on to they phones for longer time.
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Just ordered S24 ultra with delivery on Monday,"
K-JGaqfIOmI,Great review!!!!❤
K-JGaqfIOmI,GSMArena is always BEST❤❤❤❤❤
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Very nice review, S24 Ultra is highly enjoyable flagship model. Absolute unit of a smartphone 💯"
K-JGaqfIOmI,I'm waiting on my new s24 ultra in the mail. Going from a barely functional s7 to this is going to be nice.
K-JGaqfIOmI,I really like GSM Arena   especially this dud 3>
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Thank you for a good review. Im waiting for mine beeing delivered. Ordered this weekend, for $725 here in Norway. I guess that is a reasonable good deal?"
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Great review,I'm enjoying my S24 Ultra."
K-JGaqfIOmI,The material is so good that the metal does not become hot if used continuously.
K-JGaqfIOmI,Superb review sir. Please make a Battery drain test of S23 Ultra vs S24 Ultra vs 15 Pro max
K-JGaqfIOmI,Great video thanks for the great effort and I have a question
K-JGaqfIOmI,🎉🎉🎉 a really great phone
K-JGaqfIOmI,May I ask what is the background music at the beginning of the video🤣
K-JGaqfIOmI,"I don't care who has the best camera or is the fastest phone in benchmarks. Every flagship smartphone takes super pictures and video's and is blazing fast. 97% of all smartphone users don't even see the differences.
I'm a SMARTPHONE user so I want the best screen (dpi/brightness/anti-glare), best battery, best/most usablility and productivity options, best gaming- and multi-media experience, best personalization options and best innovation. 
I want DEX, KNOX, S-PEN, call recording, multi-tasking, multi-window, fingerprint scanner, best screen, widgets, themes, integration with windows, the biggest eco-system (Samsung SmartThings), fast charging, fast wireless charging, SEVEN YEARS OF UPDATES and I want AI.
On all these aspects the S24 Ultra is destroying the iphone 15 PM big time.  So why keep people buying these antiquated, restricted and very very limited iphones?"
K-JGaqfIOmI,USING S series since Galaxy S2... now using s24 ultra... best phone ver ...
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Sorry, but may it be that you confused the namings left / right on the photo comparison? Because everything you said regarding where the s24 was better, felt like  you were talking about the right part of the picture, because it is more defined, more detail, more texture, better dyncamic range... check out the 5x vs 3x at 07:21 for example. Or the night-scene at 06:24. the right part (""s23"") looks better to my eyes, noticeably! It would also be helpful, if you sometimes mark something in those shots with a pen, so watcher can see a hint which example / detail you mean in the picture. At 6:21 -> check out the wall wwhere the 3 little trees are in front. The Right picutre is way more defined / detailed / lit up! Or look at the bricks  texture at the building... obvious! Best regards :)"
K-JGaqfIOmI,"I've had the phone for 5 days, A52S 5g- switched, feels like a hyper jump. Battery life, camera zoom, speed, looks and s-pen are amazing. I thought about switching to s25 ultra but I don't like the rounded look of it."
K-JGaqfIOmI,I understand their an update fix for the Vivid setting to obviously be more VIVID .Remember the screen has the Anti Glare effect so the screen is appears darker. That would be effected by a screen protector. The Anti Glare feature appears to be forgotten by Samsung wich it ironically is not promoted???🤔Note to future proof your phone  if possible get the 512gb  or 1Terebyte Version. This will increase the resale value. Plus add a motivation for buying. I am using the S22 Ultra 512 version. At the time the seller upgraded to the S23 Ultra and was moving to each new iteration as part of his job. So I got the S22 Ultra a year ago on Ebay for $430 What a surprise. Good Timing 😎 Good Video 😎
K-JGaqfIOmI,"But I still haven't seen anyone asking Samsung, why these super powerful Ultra phones, which can record 4k 120, 8K, translate phono calls in real time etc., still aren't able to, in Pro Video to adjust contrast, saturation, shadows etc. in anything higher that FHD resolution!!
I really don't get it, people shooting ""Pro"" often want to have a more flat picture, with less contrast and less saturation, but Pro people don't use 4k ?
I can't be a processor limit, but why??"
K-JGaqfIOmI,I liked the room decor
K-JGaqfIOmI,I like this s24 ultra
K-JGaqfIOmI,Question : Does a gel case for this phone impede using the stylus?
K-JGaqfIOmI,"So much love this phone, wish I could be given one as a gift"
K-JGaqfIOmI,weeks behind - love u no matter.
K-JGaqfIOmI,5x Lens is 50MP correct? Also in Expert RAAW you can change the primary lens to shoot at 24MP and it's 2x the detail. In Camera Assistant you can also change the Auto Lens setting. Why do reviewers leave the fine details out?
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Someone has to say it ""the intro was 🔥"""
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Finally watching this review on my Samsung S24 Ultra, newly bought."
K-JGaqfIOmI,This intro is amazing
K-JGaqfIOmI,Getting mines tomorrow for father's day
K-JGaqfIOmI,Very good review. Great job 👍🏼❤
K-JGaqfIOmI,What is the price of this specific phone 📱???????? 1:04
K-JGaqfIOmI,I was a consistent S series user but switched to the Fold 4 from my S22 Ultra about two years ago. The screen seems to look bigger on the newer S models. I'm torn between upgrading my Fold (although there don't seem to be many differences in the newer Folds compared to my Fold 4) or going for the newer S series.
K-JGaqfIOmI,*Watching this on my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 1TB version.*
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Just upgraded from my note 10+ which i have loved but im excited to get my new s24 ultra in the mail tomorrow. 
Im glad they got rid of the cureved screen i felt like my note was more fragile because of it."
K-JGaqfIOmI,Amazing phone this is the phone of the year already even though the phone is expensive but who cares this phone is the perfect flagship phone ever yet it is similar to the s23 ultra i upgraded from budget phone to this beast and this is the best upgrade ever especially the cameras the battery life the screen quality and the amazing samsung features overall its a wonderful smartphone
K-JGaqfIOmI,Great video
K-JGaqfIOmI,"2:30 don't understand why the refresh rate only can go down to 24hz instead of 1hz when the screen is static, even in Always on display mode."
K-JGaqfIOmI,It still surprises me how samsung can add a pen and still make a phone water resistant this is to show the removal of headphone jack is just a marketing scheme for their Buds
K-JGaqfIOmI,is there any samsung s24 ultra which has the sim card tray on the right side of the phone or that is a clone?
K-JGaqfIOmI,"my dream phone! 
gotta study hard to be able to afford one in thee future"
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Thanks for a helpful and informative review.    I also regularly visit your website, which is great for reviews of all the latest smartphones."
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Hi,
﻿
﻿I have noticed that the frame around the 50MP periscope telephoto camera on my phone is slightly tilted, approximately 5-7 degrees off from the vertical or relative to the phone's vertical edge. This seems like it could be an assembly issue during production.
﻿
﻿Could other users with a 50MP periscope telephoto lens check their cameras for any similar tilt in the frame relative to the vertical or phone edge? I’d appreciate any feedback on this.
﻿
﻿Thank you!"
K-JGaqfIOmI,"I would like to give a suggestion to Samsung, Samsung should create a different type of animation for their fingerprint! And fingerprint unlock vibration must also be kept."
K-JGaqfIOmI,Best smartphone ❤
K-JGaqfIOmI,Where's the Oppo Find X7 Ultra review? It's been well over a month
K-JGaqfIOmI,"I love Android, especially Samsung. I've been considering getting a new phone, but there's a complete deal breaker for me: I've never been able to get voice commands to work using the Gboard keyboard. Since I dislike the other keyboards available on Android, I don't really have a solution.

I've always stuck with iPhone because of this issue. The voice command on iPhone may not be the best—neither as fast nor as effective as on Android—but at least it works.

If anyone has a solution that works, I'd be ready to switch back to Android, because the Galaxy S24 Ultra is really tempting me.

The only Android phone where I find that voice commands work right out of the box is on Google's Pixels. The problem is that I don't necessarily want a Pixel; I generally prefer Samsung, especially their high-end models.

It not only allows me to write much faster to many different people, but I am also disabled, so it's much less exhausting for me to speak than to type long texts by hand"
K-JGaqfIOmI,Had to get this for the reason of the exynos chipset being complete ass. The performance gap may have got closer over the years but my god the stuttering and random lag spikes you get when navigating the phone is ridiculous and its been on every samsung device that I had with this chipset im surprised no one is complaining about this. I saw the opportunity to grab not only a great chipset but one of the best phones Ive seen in a while
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Nice photo no way I say anything else, but from S23 ultra to S24 ultra  I'm not interesting.
I prefer the build quality of S23 ultra, looks and feels more solid.."
K-JGaqfIOmI,nice intro by the way👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
K-JGaqfIOmI,SAMSUNG needs to do a lot more to catch up VIVO X100 PRO.
K-JGaqfIOmI,I traded my S22 for the S24 Ultra. Thrilled with my new toy
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Anybody know if the issue on release with the vivid display option and wether it got resolved on updates? 

I know on release people were complaining that they couldn't change their screen setting from dynamic to vivid. Apparently left the screen really dark and lacking brightness. 

Thanks guys."
K-JGaqfIOmI,Great video as always! I know that the specs saying different but in your lab tests the iPhone display was brighter right?
K-JGaqfIOmI,love the shirt
K-JGaqfIOmI,"Nubia Z60 Ultra is a tough challenger... Samsung needs to tap that ""notchless"" flagship market 😌"
K-JGaqfIOmI,I have the S23U. Is upgrading to the S24U really worth the ~$675 it would cost me if I did a trade in? Seems kind of steep to me...$300-350 and i would probably be doing it. What do u guys think?
K-JGaqfIOmI,"I’m watching this video on my iPhone 15 Pro Max Titanium Blue 1TB

And I’m enjoying it 😂"
K-JGaqfIOmI,Between the samsung s24 and Google Pixel 9 which one has the overall best Camera quality with quality zoom and Battery health?
K-JGaqfIOmI,Love Samsung
K-JGaqfIOmI,What camera sensor does the Samsung s24 ultra and  S24 used?
K-JGaqfIOmI,Good review but Why do your camera review looks bad..what is the format of the camera..and when shooting video make sure you have different samples not the overview of the city it looks grainy .shoot videos of something a 4 metres away atmost
K-JGaqfIOmI,What is the colour variant of your s24u ?
K-JGaqfIOmI,Watching this from my S24 Ultra 🔥
K-JGaqfIOmI,confused ...should i go for s24ultra or any of foldable or any other companies flagship.?opinion  who have recently switched to new phone ..and plz android not iphone ..
K-JGaqfIOmI,4:59 Show us how you your battery tests. Start with 15 Pro max vs S24Ultra
K-JGaqfIOmI,4k at 120fps then it should also record 1080p at 480fps easily.
K-JGaqfIOmI,Watching on on my s23+😆😆😆😆
K-JGaqfIOmI,This phone is my favorite phone
K-JGaqfIOmI,I can close my eyes and say it is the best phone of 2024
K-JGaqfIOmI,Nice.
K-JGaqfIOmI,Mi14Ultra or S24Ultra in July 2024 after all the software updates?  Priority is long-term use (using k20pro) and good camera for recording indoor videos for youtube.
K-JGaqfIOmI,no regrets to leave my Note 9 behind for this big guy.
K-JGaqfIOmI,The s pen is so much more than what you said. It's totally better than the s23 with lots more features. How you can say that there wasn't any change is a joke.
K-JGaqfIOmI,Amazing samsung galaxy ultra24 in the world 💪😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊

z598clQ71JY,"quick answer from a user who pre-ordered and has been using it as a daily driver since - Yes, totally worth it, battery life is fantastic, display is gorgeous, nice and bright out in the sun. love it."
z598clQ71JY,"Kinda funny now that everyone has a camera in their pocket, Bigfoot hasn't been seen since."
z598clQ71JY,"You will never be satisfied with any phone if one expects 100% perfection , its still an amazing phone."
z598clQ71JY,I've just finished a 18 day trip around Europe. I took 100s of images and videos. My S24U was my only camera. I have amazing day and night footage... Thanks for a real good video👍🏻
z598clQ71JY,Broke but still watching
z598clQ71JY,I moved from note9 to s24 ultra.. what an insane jump  !
z598clQ71JY,"For anyone confused: ""stand-by battery"" is not a second battery. It means how much power the one battery uses when the phone is not actively being used."
z598clQ71JY,"After trying out the Iphone 15 pro max for a week, I switched to the s24 ultra & honestly it's the best phone. Not 100% perfect but simply the best 👌"
z598clQ71JY,You guys remember back in 2011 when the samsung s2 felt like one of the best phones ever? Oh how times and technologies have changed...
z598clQ71JY,"At 58, I went from the cheapest phones from Tracphone for a 2 week road trip for emergencies, to my last was Samsung A53 5G, to the one I got Wednesday, the unlocked Samsung S24 Ultra.  I went from the 19th century to the 23rd with this jump in tech.  Since I got I have been playing with it to remove all the crap and turn off all the background stuff and make sure it is set right.  THANKS for the tips.   At 68, I am amazed at the capabilities of a hand held device.  I grew up with the original Star Trek and the Doctors hand held device is here!     I'm happy I can still be amazed at the new tech."
z598clQ71JY,"Nice. I'll likely move back to Samsung in 2025 for the S25 Ultra. 

My iPhone 15 Pro battery isn't kicking it for me. I also miss the Samsung ecosystem; especially the S-Pen, which I use a lot."
z598clQ71JY,"7 years of updates?! Samsung, are you trying to break the record for the longest-lasting smartphone? This is amazing value!"
z598clQ71JY,"Fyi the goodlock update was pushed out about a month ago, at least for my unlocked u.s. version. One other thing as to the s pen, NOBODY ever mentions its website usage. It's why i find the s pen so useful. For small hyperlinks, forms, and maps. Furthermore i need extremely precise map coordinates for search & rescue as well as noaa maps, and the s pen does what a finger cannot. That said, great job on the video, thanks!"
z598clQ71JY,"Something everyone misses about screen saturation on the S24s is that by default the saturation slider is set to the lowest. Go into settings>display>adaptive colour tone and turn it off. Then go into screen mode, select ""vivid"" then the ""advanced settings"" button. You will get a 3 step slider. By default it is set to the lowest. I have mine in the middle. But if you like the old samsung overly saturated look, you can get it by sliding it to the max. The screen is amazing either way. And then you CAN turn adaptive colour tone back on."
z598clQ71JY,The saturation problem was a bug. They added the vividness slider with an update and fixed it.
z598clQ71JY,Every flagship is worth it even if its 1 year later ngl.
z598clQ71JY,"U watch a samsung review, they say Google does better
U watch a Pixel review, they say Samsung does better
Don't believe in these tech reviewers we consumers won't have a problem with anything 
Plus we are very impressed by the spen never seen such tech on a phone"
z598clQ71JY,"It is the Swiss Army knife of smartphones. If you dig an abundance of features, including the kitchen sink, then the S24U wins."
z598clQ71JY,Any iPhone users that don’t regret going to this? I’m really thinking about going to this. I went on a trip and my pictures were terrible next to the pictures my friend took on her galaxy
z598clQ71JY,I just got the s24 Ultra 2days ago and so far I'm happy with the phone
z598clQ71JY,I love the s pen the performance the cameras  the build and battery i get about 2days almost i sold my 15 pro and couldn't be more happier ❤
z598clQ71JY,I got used to the S Pen on my small Note20 so I bought the S24Ultra to continue to enjoy the advantages. The S Pen is much more precise in choosing things on the screen (like the tiny 'X's to close annoying overlay ads). I also suspect the oleophobic coating on the screen to last longer 🤞
z598clQ71JY,"I realized how much Samsung was giving for a s23u and decided I should trade mine in.  

This change in shape and the new front glass are incredible."
z598clQ71JY,Shame on them for still not adding an SD card back on the phone.
z598clQ71JY,"Coming from a pre-ordered Note 20 Ultra, this thing has been fantastic! Definitely a fan of the decision to drop the curved edges. The battery life has been amazing, and the cameras are a nice improvement for me, despite the sometimes odd post processing. Ready to have this thing for the next 7 years"
z598clQ71JY,I absolutely love love love my s24 ultra ❤
z598clQ71JY,"Every phone have pros and cons…no one is perfect… but in the S24U i see an good all rounder. Yes, the price is still pretty big, but probably before Black Friday or on BF will be at an more resonable price i hope. I want to switch from an iPhone 13(not pro, the simple one) to S24U and i’m convinced that the camera is not that spectaular how many many youtubers said…but you get the job done with it…at least is a flagship phone…
Good job with the video!"
z598clQ71JY,"I love it, dont see a need to upgrade from this for a few years especially since I purchased a mirrorless camera and the only improvement I can think of would be the camera"
z598clQ71JY,"I keep going back to my S24U opposed to my P8. After using standard Galaxy or the ""Plus"" verisons from S8-S10 era's, I figured I drop my S21 for the premium S24U. This thing is so good when it comes to shooting concert shots, fast / responsive interface, battery, cooling, customization, display. I will try out my P8 every other month or in special use cases when not wanting to lug around a larger phone. I find the software fun with the haptics and animations on the P8, but the S24U always feels like home. 

I hope Samsung one day can bring the flagship Ultra into a smaller, rounded corner variation like Google is doing with the P9 Pro. I'm VERY interested."
z598clQ71JY,"i love my S24, i cant see myself go to any other phones at the moment."
z598clQ71JY,"The problem with the S24U’s camera this year is that the yellow haunting color is too heavy on the 5x camera, many users from all over the country complain, but Samsung still ignores that problem and after many updates this situation remains unchanged. Especially the terrible yellow haunting situation occurs when filming videos at the 5x camera. You can fix Whit Balance by pro mode but in this mode you cannot be switched between cameras. It's so stupid. They even removed the feature of recording portrait videos 3x optical in the previously existing on the S23U."
z598clQ71JY,"I don't think your camera review is fair, because u keep comparing the phone to a device that is dedicated to take pics in high quality, and still the phones camera stands out to the Fujifilm camera"
z598clQ71JY,"I have a VW Golf for everyday usage.Never crossed my mind to to buy a Ferrari for an occasional trip.
Thanks for informing me that a more expensive dedicated camera   takes a better picture than a smartphone. 
Brilliant 👏 👏"
z598clQ71JY,Qucik answer from someone who as been using android for a long time and switched to iphone 16 pro max... you now already know why im looking at this video :)... Cant wait to get rid of the iphone 16 pro max
z598clQ71JY,I like the pacing not to fast. You have a clear voice and can be understand well. Love your video.
z598clQ71JY,Im very happy with my Galaxy S24 Ultra. It's amazing powerful beautiful smartphone. Love you Samsung 4K
z598clQ71JY,"If I was going to get this I would also want a case for protection, how does the phone feel when moving around with it in your pocket? Also when sitting is it snug or does it fall out easily? I still have a iPhone 8plus"
z598clQ71JY,I do not want to be buying a whole ass camera to take better pics lol. I just want a phone i can carry around
z598clQ71JY,"I agree very much with this review about it being worth it or not. I'd like to get the S24+ instead, but it comes with Exynos in my region (Brazil). Only the S24U comes with Snapdragon 8 Gen3 here.

The alternative would be the much more well priced S23+, but August 2nd is my b-day and I wanted to splurge on a top tier smartphone to swap my Galaxy A51 for and keep it for years."
z598clQ71JY,"I have the s22 ultra but I figure my up grade would be s24 ultra, much cheaper than the s25 ultra."
z598clQ71JY,Thank you for mentioning about the PWM. Its an important phone aspect that is rarely mentioned by youtube tech reviewers.
z598clQ71JY,If you're paying 1500+ for a phone it BETTER perform FLAWLESSLY
z598clQ71JY,"If u want absolute best camera s24 ultra isnt for u better of with dslr, if u want best battery s24 u again isnt the choice, go for one of those bulky bricks of a phone with 6-10k mah batteries, if u want fastest charging then its better to go with budget androids that have 100-240 watt charging, if u want smoothest ui u can stick with stock android like that on pixel or ios but but if u want the best versatile phone there is the phone with everything then s24 ultra might be it Best ever display, one of the best cameras, one of the best battery timing, one of the best ui if not the best, best looking too in my opinion and waterproofing then s24 ultra is the only chocie"
z598clQ71JY,Have been trying to figure out how to reconfigure holding the lock button from bixby to google assistant since i bought this phone and you finally helped me figure out how. literally game changing. Thanks!
z598clQ71JY,"It's a good jack of all trades, master of none kind of device. Hopefully some slightly more advances is added to the mix next iterations."
z598clQ71JY,Just got the s24 ultra 2 days ago. Best phone I've ever had. Love it.
z598clQ71JY,"I upgraded from an S22 Ultra to an S24 Ultra 2 days ago, and honestly, the experience is almost identical. The main reasons I upgraded are that my old phone had some scratches on the front screen and bezel, and I also wanted 7 years of software support. The S22 Ultra is only good for 3 Android version updates, and next year would be its last one. It will receive security patches for a while, but after Android 15, there will be no more official versions for it.

I'm hoping to keep this one for a long time. Prior to the S21 Ultra 5G (Exynos) and S22 Ultra (Snapdragon), I had my S7 for over 5 years. Now that everything just feels like an incremental upgrade, I think that I will stay put."
z598clQ71JY,"I have purchased Samsung phones exclusively since cell phones came on the scene. My current phone is the Z Fold 4; however, that phone became virtually unusable when it suffered from what I understand is a not so uncommon problem: when I fold and close the phone (from its very impressive full screen) it shuts off. I mean, it powers down completely and the only way to access the phone is to turn it on and go through the power-on protocol. This means, I now must use my phone as a tablet, unless I am willing to go through the 2-3 minute power-on process each time I close the phone. I am passed warranty and repairs here in Mexico are somewhat problematic AND, how can you not have your phone for the days required for it to be repaired, a cost, I have been told, also appears to be steep... So, I have decided to switch from the foldable phones (which are beautiful) and I've ordered the S24 Ultra. I do hope the transition to a small screen won't be too much of a disappointment. Then again--to not have your phone work is a pretty serious disappointment in itself.    Thank you for the fair assessment of the S24 Ultra. By the way (oh, can yammer so) I have extensive high-quality photography gear. That said, the convenience of have my always-available phone/camera has allowed me to take innumerable high-quality photographs I would not have had were it not for my phone. The photos I have taken with my Samsung phones, given the nature of the equipment, have been and continue to be superb. I do run them through Snapseed software, and, again, given the nature of the equipment, I couldn't be happier. ... Thanks for allowing me space to ramble."
z598clQ71JY,"I switched from iPhone 15 pro back to android samsung s24 ultra  , and my experience so far is amazing,  I love screen , the 5x zoom replacing the 10x was a conscious decision,  I find the phone gave me a better experience and value over the iPhone"
z598clQ71JY,"I am using it, its been a year, i love it, i usually change phones each year but this time i am taking a break as s25 ultra failed to beat its predecessor"
z598clQ71JY,You can't review a 200 megapixel camera phone if you put the setting to 12 megapixels! that's outrageous.
z598clQ71JY,"In
most of the cases G- Board works better even using s_per but Samsung integrated AI chat assist is amazing though..."
z598clQ71JY,I get a new phone every 1yr 10 months exactly. My current phone is the s22 ultra and I love it. Battery is still pretty good. I have the s24 ultra on the way and I'm excited to get it
z598clQ71JY,Broke also but happy. Just bought an S24 Ultra 1TB. 😂
z598clQ71JY,Go to your Settings to Keep menu. You can have it open the camera in any setting you wish to use.
z598clQ71JY,Moving from note 10+ to this hope i love it like i love my note 10+ :)
z598clQ71JY,Good that you mention about the PWM
z598clQ71JY,Watching this vid from my brand new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra... The first advanced phone I've had and finally had the chance to afford and in just thrilled 🥰
z598clQ71JY,"I think most consumers are not photophiles who nitpick about those types of details. They just want some memories captured for future reference, and any modern phone will do just that."
z598clQ71JY,Got mine couple of months and it's simply amazing 🎉
z598clQ71JY,Might be the first Android/Samsung phone Apple users do not want to argue about
z598clQ71JY,I’m getting this phone because there will be a price drop. I don’t like the rounded screen edges of the S22 Ultra.
z598clQ71JY,"I love this phone, and I've literally never been able to keep a phone for more than 6 months ever since I've been an adult. I am keeping this. Even compared to the Pixel 9 XL which I just got-- I'm keeping this, I'm returning the Pixel. It's just a damn good phone."
z598clQ71JY,I have a question is it worth it to use for 5-6 more years?
z598clQ71JY,6 months later its still the best phone!  Until S25 Ultra is released you will have to be satisfied that this is the best selling flagship phone in the world.
z598clQ71JY,I loved samsung when they had the pop off back cover and you could pop in a new battery
z598clQ71JY,"Totally agree with your point with regards to the camera.  For everyday shots, the smartphone absolutely all day long.  But if you're going to be taking photos at important events such as weddings and things like that, especially if you were doing it as a favour for someone,  you would NOT be using a smartphone.  That's just fact.  You would use a dedicated camera for that.  Other than that though, I am looking to upgrade my s20+ so I think this would be awesome."
z598clQ71JY,"my biggest issue is camera, specially when i photo people. it enhances every little thing on their/my face and it can be very bad. plus, it always makes face too light. when i look at ppl before taking pics, it looks realistic and i would like it that way but it process it as i don't want. i tried every advice but doesn't help. everything else is 100/100 but because of a camera, i wouldn't pay it so much anymore."
z598clQ71JY,"I have no problem with having no user replaceable batteries as long as they dont charge stupid amounts for a change. People need to realize that dust/waterproof ratings would be impacted by having different type of seals, and also structural integrity would be impacted by making the phone easily open-able for average user."
z598clQ71JY,"The truth is if the device could edit professional AutoCAD software or other drawing software 
Integration of the pen then was something special Includes LiDAR sensor The device would really bring some real benefit  As long as there is no integration of the pen to the graphics where useless, Buying a device that has something in it that I don't use is pointless"
z598clQ71JY,"Watched a phone review video and not a single word was mentioned about the call quality and voice quality of the phone. Also, why are you comparing an innate camera with a phone camera? Apples to oranges man. People do not buy phones only to take photos. They buy them for other stuff too. If you want to take insanely clear, sharp pictures, then a dedicated camera is what you want. This video was mildly annoying because of those two things alone."
z598clQ71JY,"3:48 The ""over-sharpening"" is due to the camera sensor in the phone having poorer dynamic range compared to the Fuji"
z598clQ71JY,I went to buy the 24 ultra and walked out with S24 plus why because all I wanted was a new decent phone for calling and taking pictures
z598clQ71JY,You totally forgot about 4k120 recording on the main and ultra wide cameras. That alone is worth the upgrade for serious content creators.
z598clQ71JY,"A few days ago I purchased this phone, and I will have it delivered soon. I believe it won't disappoint me (I am switching from old Mate 20)."
z598clQ71JY,"I'm an owner of 15 pro max and S24 Ultra.15 pro max beats S24 Ultra in terms of battery and OnePlus 12 as well.
I wish Samsung last longer than an Apple phone.

And one more thing it's rectangular design is not comfortable at all"
z598clQ71JY,"For a good portrait, I don't take 18 meg pixel picture, like you are saying. My picture must be at least 48 meg pixels.
    Now it has been over 7 months, the S24 ultra is still beating any iPhone out in the market."
z598clQ71JY,Usable photos is unacceptable when s23 ultra is so much better.
z598clQ71JY,I got a case for my s24 ultra and do I need to buy something to protect the camera?
z598clQ71JY,"Hello friends! Should I get the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, the DJI Pocket 3 camera, or the regular iPhone 14 Pro for YouTube? I wanted to do vlogs and podcasts with better camera quality and that same portrait shot, but I'm really stuck between these two in terms of camera quality."
z598clQ71JY,i will not buy a dedicated camera.  the s24 ultra is good enough and more.
z598clQ71JY,Still the best designed phone on the market in my opinion despite the sharp corners. The body screen is perfect for watching content and interacting with the interface. Will hold on to this for years to come.
z598clQ71JY,So I found the best help for the over processing of images is to go into the gallery settings and turn super hdr off.
z598clQ71JY,When he started talking about the camera stuff I had no idea what he was talking about.It takes good pics that’s all that matters
z598clQ71JY,"I need the satellite connectivity! Can this phone be updated to get it, or is the hardware just not there and need to wait for the 25? Please help!"
z598clQ71JY,This is more of a review of your personal preferences. Just because you don't use certain features doesnt mean others dont.
z598clQ71JY,Well said. If I really want a proper camera I would default to a handheld camera. Nowadays even mid range phones are producing great photos and videos.
z598clQ71JY,"One thing I've noticed in mine, is that the phone heats up when using camera stuff. Which I assume is because of AI integration working simultaneously, but I dunno exactly why"
z598clQ71JY,"HELP! I'm having a problem with my unit.Had it for 3 months now, my screen all of a sudden went black.The phone is still on but I can't see anything on my screen anymore"
z598clQ71JY,"I do understand why people want a good camera, but let's be honest: Apart from photographers and ""Pixel Counters"" a regular person can't tell the difference between a Samsung XXX XXX and a Nokia Lumia 1020 from 2013. Even on a PC Screen. Smartphone Cameras (in Daylight) are good enough for a LONG TIME now.
If you really want to take photos and print them on everything thats a little bit larger, you need a DLSR anyway, since the quality difference is enormous because of the lens."
z598clQ71JY,"Was thinking to get this phone for gaming and emulation. But since it was way too expensive and didn't wanted to pay so much money for it, i decided to go for Poco F6, and have no regrets."
z598clQ71JY,I'm switching to S24 Ultra after 3.5 years with Xiaomi Mi11. And as a person who works with smartphones on daily basis I know it's gonna be a big upgrade. Partly because of raw power since I plan to use PlayStation 2 emulator to be able to basically relive my childhood on the go. And where Mi11 struggles with some games I feel like S24 Ultra will run all of them smoothly
z598clQ71JY,I'm going to get this phone next year 5 00 mah battery and 256 GB.
z598clQ71JY,"Sorry but those ""overly focused"" shots the Samsung takes over that Fuji thing, are so much better.  Can never have ""too much"" focus."
z598clQ71JY,"Got the S24U as my work phone but ive caught myself using it more than my iPhone 15PM, such a good all around phone !"
z598clQ71JY,Finally they increased the damn PWM it only took millions of people complaining about eye strain and headaches. Hopefully these companies get rid of PWM all together.
z598clQ71JY,Still the lock screen media player not fixed?
z598clQ71JY,"@11:16 I see the SimCard slot, the USB C slot and the S-pen slot...but what is the slot in-between the USB C and the S-Pen slot??? Did samsung bring back the micro SD card slot?"
z598clQ71JY,"With this camera software (it seems even worse then S23U which was already terrible), S24U can't even be considered good phone, let alone great or the best. Paying over 1000 bucks for flagship in 2024. and then ending up with blurry pictures of anything with even slight movement (and many other camera problems)... should not be acceptable."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Do you have a Galaxy s24 ultra🤔 SUBSCRIBE if you like tech content😀
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Someone finally mentioned signing documents!! That's a life changer. Makes work stuff more efficient
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Me thinking its Mr Beast from the thumbnail⚰️
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I kinda want to upgrade to S24U but my S22 ultra still works fine
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"The S Pen is seriously one of the most underrated tools. I use it for everything -taking notes, snapping group photos, signing documents, and even for those casual flex moments. One of the coolest features is how it effortlessly converts my less-than-perfect handwriting into clean, typed text. I remember back when I used take class notes with the S Pen-it was so efficient and easy to use. It's amazing how they packed so much functionality into such a small, sleek pen!"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"I am a s21 user, s24u is my dream phone ❤"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I agree with you.  That's why I will keep my S24U until the next version will continue having a Bluetooth s-pen.
elYbZ0z2Qr0,The most important and useful feature of s pen that nobody talks about is that you can copy literally every text on your screen at any time. Places where you cant do that on other phones. Take instagram as example. I dont know any other phone that can copy text from instagram bios or post descriptions. I have been a lover of note series. Now it is the s series.
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"As a student who loves photography, S24 really is a must for me😭😭"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"The Samsung s24 ultra is my Dream phone 

Like if the s24 ultra ur Dream phone"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,S23 can do all this already
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"I've owned several notes, and now the S24 Ultra as well. I've used the S-Pen for many things, signing documents, sketching up remodel ideas, etc, but never to trigger the camera. For that, I use what I believe is the most underrated Samsung feature, voice activated camera."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,It can also zoom in and zoom out using the pen
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Agree but the recent update makes the battery short lived
elYbZ0z2Qr0,It helps so much with studying and editing documents
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Audio jack still more useful as s24u owner 
When i want to sign a document i will not take my pen for it to much trouble 
And most case make it so hard for me to actually pull the pen so"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I love my s24 ultra.
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"This feature is not just for s24 ultra, its for 22 and 23 too"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,S24 Plus Is on my wishlist
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Watching on S24 ultra!
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I love this phone. Wont need to upgrade for a long time
elYbZ0z2Qr0,This has been the case since Note 20 Ultra (2020). People have really been missing out on Samsung
elYbZ0z2Qr0,My manager asked me all the time to print papers and then write info inside them manually ... i used the s pen to just write everything inside the pdf and then send it back without even printing .. It's the best feature ever
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"To be honest, I can't afford a thousand dollar bag no matter how beautiful it is. I can say with certainty that every   kislux   bag I've owned has been solid. Beautiful leather, top-notch hardware, amazing craftsmanship, and a clean silhouette and size that I love. I've been well worth every dollar I've spent, and they've held up perfectly for years."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,SAMSUNG truly releases phones ahead of its time
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Who noticed the Nothing wallpaper 🤩
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Actually yes. I have never had this phone but it amazes me how in the top comparisons of flagships, the pen is either briefly mentioned or even completely ignored, like it is a complete piece of hardware that no other phone carries an alternative of!"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,That's why I love samsung❤❤❤
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I have a samsung tablet as well. The pencil really helps because I can use both pens for both devices.
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Samsung note for life! Since the Note 3
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Metal scratching sound effect 😭
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I use the pen and every feature in a daily basis since note s3!!
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I'm using s24.. it's an amazing smartphone I have ever had.
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Commenting from my third S24 Ultra 🤌
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"For me Samsung are great I like their products but my issue with this new phones ultra is that the S Pen makes them big while S before had a better thinness. I never really liked Samsung notes due to that, so if I'm buying a Samsung S series phones it will be an S or S+ either aiming to an ultra."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Samsung Is Wild 💎
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"S23 Ultra: 👁️👄👁️
S22 Ultra: 👁️👄👁️ 
The entire Note lineup: 👁️👄👁️"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,WHAT THE I NEED TO BYE THAT😭😭😭
elYbZ0z2Qr0,FYI all.  Always get insurance.  Samsung is infamous for not covering malfunctions!!!!!
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Nathan Espinoza's long lost twin
elYbZ0z2Qr0,it's great for ds emulation too
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I've just upgraded from my s20 to the s24. So happy with it.
elYbZ0z2Qr0,It’s a wand for changing settings in camera XD. Gotta say this feature is really SICK
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Not just that.
I also use it like a laptop for PowerPoint presentation just dont forget to put it on airplane mode"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I'm watching this from an s24 Ultra and fr the signing documents is underrated
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"This feature can do a LOT of things, but you need to set it up. This feature is called 'Air Actions'."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Super high tech phone that can turn into a car, portable jet, and a rocketship released. 
A few months later, “is this phone underrated?”"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,S24ultra dream phone 😢❤
elYbZ0z2Qr0,24 Ultra lets goo. 25 ultra doesnt have this feature. Im never giving this phone up
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"What's even more underrated is some people think it's simply a stylus, but it's actually a proper Wacom pen exactly as high-end art tablets and displays."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,How did y'all forget about the note 20 💀
elYbZ0z2Qr0,for me it is very useful especially when I draw in ibispaint
elYbZ0z2Qr0,NOT ANY MORE….. THEY REMOVED BLUETOOTH…….  😢😢😢
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"The reason it's not actually underrated at all, is the fact that people buy this phone because of the S-Pen, it's not like people are buying it and then going oh nice surprise I have a pen"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,OMG I didn't know that thank you dude!!!
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Reasons why I ❤this phone 📱 that pen 🖊️ is a huge turn on🥰🥰🥰
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"But when I bought the thing, I was always nervous to keep the pen inside since I thought it would get stuck"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Unfortenately as a Turkish student I would use it for study lessons from pdfs xd
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Watching this from my S24 Ultra. Best decision that i made.🎉
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Watching on my Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus🙂
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"""Can ur Apple do that"" 🗣️🗣️🗣️🤫🤫🔥🔥🔥"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"The S Pen is definitely underrated. I'm a Dry Van dispatcher and sometimes I'm on the go without my laptop. 
Signing documents is a breeze with that little thing. In that specific use case, it makes it super valuable."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"IPHONE: WE WILL HAVE SPLIT SCREEN ON 2028, PEN ON 2030 AND OF COURSE WE WILL INCREASE THE PRICE 🤣🤣🤣"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Since my first galaxy note this is the most important thing about having a Note/ Ultra device. Note,  Note II, Note 4, Note 9 and S24 Ultra. Incredible devices for their time and the spen was always a main reason when buying them"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Meanwhile me using s22 ultra with all the feature ahown in the video: 😐😑🤦‍♂️
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"As a student in a medical college, and a waiter, the S-pen of the s24 ultra for me is very convinient when talking quick notes or reminders during the class on the go."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I owned a note 9 for 8 yesrs... it's really... not big😐
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Bad thing about the s pen: no no Bluetooth anymore 😢
elYbZ0z2Qr0,What documents is bro signing ☠️
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"I'm a developer, I use this pen to roughly draw designs and learn algorithms."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Wingardiam levi-osa **presses s-pen button** => **takes picture**
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Writing and signing docs is so easy😊
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"This guy: ""the fact that it is stored inside the phone is a game changer""
A phone that i had like 8 years ago: wtf
💀 😎😂"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I bought it 2 months ago and this is the best choice I have ever made🎉🎉
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Bro, the S22 Ultra does the same shit, little bro. 😂😩"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,You can also zoom in and out by pressing the pen button and doing clockwise and anticlockwise gestures.😊
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Just got mines today and it's going to be with me till I retire in 5 years.
elYbZ0z2Qr0,remember. samsung screen from s20 series and above is very easy to get green/purple lines when the smartphone starts to heat up
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"I've had all the ultra phones, and I'll keep using them as i also used all the note series until they were discontinued. The camera and pen make this phone stand out above the other phones in the market. Especially if you take a lot of photos and edit them or sign various documents for work if necessary.  All phones should try to be more like the ultra series."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,My dad has the samsung s24 ultra 😭 and im jelly cause thats one of the best phones its better than any phone!
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Another great thing it does is control spotify. As a music lover the s pen is so nice to play songs sitting on my bed while my speakers are 5 feet away on my pc desk, without even getting near my phone."
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Best thing is that it has different functions for different applications
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I am using this everyday and i love this feature
elYbZ0z2Qr0,“can your apple do that?” 💀💀
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I have S23 ultra and its pretty cool 🎀
elYbZ0z2Qr0,I got the s22 ultra and I totally agree
elYbZ0z2Qr0,It's volume to its amazing
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"I want it so badly, gonna save up for it"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Are there people that really don't use the pen ? I say this because I use it every day and it is one of the biggest reasons.I got this phone if it hadn't been for the s pen.I would have just gotten something else entirely i've always loved the s pen though, so maybe that's why"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,The phone itself is very underrated for what it does ❤🤩
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"Meanwhile way back in the dinasaur ages the galaxy note 3 has a pen
More way back tho were phones used to have antenas"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"I have samsung s24 ultra and gosh it's very efficient in everything, its battery lasts for a very long time and it has neve bugged or lagged"
elYbZ0z2Qr0,S23 Ultra user and I couldn't be happier with this phone. I'll buy the S25 U though for the better camera and battery
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Bro the pen has been a feature for YEARS now
elYbZ0z2Qr0,We can also use the Spen for going to the home screen extra like this😅😅
elYbZ0z2Qr0,watching this on S24Ultra
elYbZ0z2Qr0,It’s like you were born yesterday or maybe Im getting old
elYbZ0z2Qr0,BRO THIS GUY IS MAKING SWITCH FROM IPHONE TO SAMSUNG AND BACK TO IPHONE 😭😭😭😭
elYbZ0z2Qr0,Another greate use is rain. When the screens soaked the stylus still works perfectly
elYbZ0z2Qr0,"If it wasn’t for the price, I would gladly pay for one, but as of now I’m just getting a new computer and oculus"
umJbhJRe67I,"When the only complaint about something is that it’s expensive, you know its a good product"
umJbhJRe67I,It's not expensive if you look at the long haul of it....7 years of updates on a phone...meaning if you plan to keep it all 7 years and not upgrade every two. It's a pretty good deal!
umJbhJRe67I,"I always used Samsung, until 2 years ago I got the iPhone 13 and I absolutely have been hating it. I JUST upgraded today and now I’m waiting for my s24 ultra!! I’m so excited to go back, I have the whole Samsung ecosystem and now I’ll feel whole again. The phone seems incredible I can’t wait!    My husband and I both upgraded 2 year old iPhone 13 base models for 2 Galaxy s24 ultras, and with our carrier it was free, we paid taxes fees and shipping altogether it was $250 for 2.  We got the lowest memory models but I mean, really."
umJbhJRe67I,"It's cheap at £1,350 for 512GB Memory, so it's not a negative point in my opinion."
umJbhJRe67I,Calling a flagship phone of 2024 expensive is inaccurate. 1300$ isn't way too much. I've seen iPhones being sold for much more money.
umJbhJRe67I,That circle to search feature would work on the S 23 and 22 and 21 I hate when companies do this crap
umJbhJRe67I,It's not expensive because there is 5% discount + £285 pounds watch free + trade in.
umJbhJRe67I,This is the best phone ever. I love my samsung galaxy
umJbhJRe67I,One UI 6.1 removed the AOD manual brightness control. Now it's just automatic and so DIM you won't be able to use the AOD. Here is hoping Samsung adds manual control back in for AOD brightness.
umJbhJRe67I,iPhones are just as expensive
umJbhJRe67I,Samsung has great trade in deals right now! I got my S24 Ultra for under 800 dollars
umJbhJRe67I,That translation feature is also available on s22u and s23u
umJbhJRe67I,I was really upset really sabotaged on a few different scenarios with Xfinity and Verizon 😢 I have had issues with my disability and hope Samsung will make it right.
umJbhJRe67I,I upgraded a month ago from my note 20 ultra and they gave a nice discount and took off $650 for my old phone and i bought the S24 ultra for $600 . I still have a lil over 6 yrs of guaranteed updates a win win from my experience!
umJbhJRe67I,Is it still worth buying in November 2024?
umJbhJRe67I,"So they have now given us a definitive support deadline. Why can’t they just support their products indefinitely? Why do I have to purchase a new phone after 7yrs? I still have and use all my old Apple products from 2011, 13, 2021. I was always a Samsung phone person until 2021 when I bought an iPhone. I was looking to purchase the S24 but this has put me off."
umJbhJRe67I,"Bought an S22 Ultra, awesome phone but wouldn't buy an Ultra again I just don't use all the features that much to justify it. Would probably buy an + model tho."
umJbhJRe67I,Absolutely THE WORST PHONE for internet that I have EVER owned. I used to have a moto g and it was OK. I thought I was upgrading to Samsung. WRONG!!! It never goes over two bars and going on the internet is like dial up. Will get my Moto g back.
umJbhJRe67I,"If your Samsung phone breaks down while under warranty you will have to mail in and be without around 2weeks if it involves taking phone apart, I have found out majority of Samsung service repair shops do not have capability, no more spending a thousand + on phones for me anymore"
umJbhJRe67I,Got mines for 500 due to my trade in plus as a member  of Samsung  buyer and got points I used to get this at 500 brand new Samsung  s24 ultra waiting for it as I post this can't wait
umJbhJRe67I,$799 Just got it.
umJbhJRe67I,"I’m thinking about switching my iPhone I was stuck between the flip , but ppl keep saying the screen gets messed up and now I’m looking at this.😊"
umJbhJRe67I,I have the note24  it is one of the most advanced phones I've had yet... prior to this phone I've had the note20  and the note9 and before that the HTC mone9
umJbhJRe67I,In Canada it is $1.800 plus taxes
umJbhJRe67I,Love this phone. Got the titanium black variant.
umJbhJRe67I,"BOOST mobile have them for 17 dollars a month depending on how many g you want what would you do. Go boost or no boost. 
Thank you."
umJbhJRe67I,6 months later these features will be on all phones. No need to spend that much money on one phone. I used a phone from 2019 to 2023. Recently I switched to a new phone. Will be using this for next 3 years.
umJbhJRe67I,I love my Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra and it was the same price...👍
umJbhJRe67I,"Well, my complaint is that the screen is of less quality than the Note 9, and what can I do? Should I wax it?"
umJbhJRe67I,Does i phone have circle search
umJbhJRe67I,Alot of the features are now on the fold 5 with one UI but my fold 5 just got picked up as 3 months old the screen has failed yet again! Sick of folds so s24 ultra is probably what I'll be going for next but if had the s23 ultra the same AI updates are coming next month to the other flagships and tab 9 ultra but makes you think if this AI is now being forced on us
umJbhJRe67I,"If the S25 Ultra releases, the price for the S24 Ultra could decrease like them iPhones. It's better to wait for another year before buying the S24 Ultra"
umJbhJRe67I,Totally ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
umJbhJRe67I,The s24 ultra natural or violet titanium worth the price ❤❤❤😊
umJbhJRe67I,I just got mine and I love it
umJbhJRe67I,The price point is ultra expensive. I don't spend my life taking pictures.
umJbhJRe67I,Gonna be going to sony since they still do headphone jack and microsd card slot.
umJbhJRe67I,Do you guys ever have the case on in reviews😂? I just ordered mine and I’m getting an otter box or something just as good
umJbhJRe67I,Jimmy really ned to add feastables ice cream
umJbhJRe67I,Oh my days I mean if you're reviewing a product don't complain about the price unless its like double or triple its competitors
umJbhJRe67I,"GSM Arena's review of this phone is not exactly complimentary, it seems the""ultra"" isn't that Ultra after all."
umJbhJRe67I,The best phone they made. I love the flat screen.
umJbhJRe67I,"Your one con was “it’s expensive” This was a slightly informative short to start, and then you crashed and burned on that stupid comment!"
umJbhJRe67I,"I have had it for 2 days and i am kinda regretting buying it 
I got a minor scratch on my screen on the first day and today i applied a screen protector and now the fingerprint sensor isn't working properly 😭"
umJbhJRe67I,I was telling one of my co workers that the galaxy phones cost more than the iPhone.
umJbhJRe67I,Been a Samsung user for over 10 years.  I have never felt so let down by the reviewers as this year.  I cannot believe that they provided a serious review without noticing the washed-out colors compared to last year's model.  I lost trust in virtually all of the top reviewers over it.  How can they not notice this? I could tell the moment I walked into the store and saw the phone that the colors were worse.
umJbhJRe67I,"Just after I got the s24 Ultra, I took a picture of the moon. Wow! 🌚
The meh, it's a heavy phone. 😕 📲"
umJbhJRe67I,"Of course Samsung will support it for seven  years, once you start paying for the A.I. you like, why would they ever want to risk you going elsewhere if they stopped supporting it sooner?"
umJbhJRe67I,NICE  ONE.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
umJbhJRe67I,Just got mine and it's a very good phone with a terrible camera system.  What the he'll were Samsung thinking??
umJbhJRe67I,Can translate calls in real time with whatsapp?
umJbhJRe67I,So she liked everything but the price😂😂😂.  I think that applies to 99% of the common  people.😂😂
umJbhJRe67I,The best phone is in your hands right now. Don’t fall in traps.
umJbhJRe67I,Did they run out of mature capable reviewers?
umJbhJRe67I,"I have it, and the camera is what I like most"
umJbhJRe67I,Yall reviews will be upgrading next year 😂
umJbhJRe67I,I'm waiting for the s25 ultra
umJbhJRe67I,My phone runs hot. Takes a long time to charge. Battery life sucks.
umJbhJRe67I,200 on Amazon
umJbhJRe67I,"I've owned mine for what feels like  6 months. This is not a working mans phone. There's not much improvement over the note 10 which isn't surprising since that phone was excellent. 
 The S24 ultra is for people who live for their phone. It's extremely fiddly and the AI is extremely suspicious. EG i looked up the calender for a date Tuesday the 26th...gee the twenty six is actually Monday gd it. The audio alert volume was lowered yesterday...today it back. Also it needs q specific case because how it's held is extremely important and it needs to still charge wirelessly. All the while it still has a crappy spell ck and it l9ves commas more than anything...to a fault. Also it's the most inconsistent phone I've ever owned. Some times the touch screen doesn't snap to it while other times I'm a half inch from the screen and it responds. Even the simple thing are not yet available such as a choice of 3 rows of word suggestions instead of numbers and emojis  rows.
 I can't stress enough how fiddly it is. It's me vs how i need my phone to behave challenge. 
 Not more than a decade ago sony started a campaign that changes the wording of instructions that made them vague. The s24ultra is similar but instead of vague it different aka there's a better way to state it. Also it has its share of wokeness. 
 Finally, I was looking at photos on a friends phone that wasn't a Samsung and they looked noticeably more clear and vibrant. Imho. Also why can't it use gps when there isn't any towers nearby? Why does the map get covered with unwanted crap when using Google maps and that stupid spin feature has never gone away since day one. I understand that it on Google but still...and how about streaming music in the car with ""downloaded "" music only for it to drop dead the moment there isn't a signal. Why isn't there a back button? They're  fkn delete buttons? There're different sorts of delete buttons! 
 On and on."
umJbhJRe67I,👍👍👍👍
umJbhJRe67I,I buy 8 of them
umJbhJRe67I,And it's tablet size
umJbhJRe67I,"why is no one talking about that the AI thing is not gona free after 2025 , it will be paid service for AI after 2025"
umJbhJRe67I,Expensive is what all the research goes into. Want peanuts than you can buy them for cheap
umJbhJRe67I,Great phones
umJbhJRe67I,You get what you pay for 🎉🎉
umJbhJRe67I,Yes s24 ultra better then 1phone 15 pro max
umJbhJRe67I,is dumb complaint about price. people expecting top notch telephone for free?? Or how much you wanna pay according to you?
umJbhJRe67I,How to pronounce your last name
umJbhJRe67I,Expensive? 😂 umm that's the going rate for many phones now days
umJbhJRe67I,My next phone to make my content

umJbhJRe67I,All flagship phones are expensive..... really? Lol. Do better.
umJbhJRe67I,"Can you ppl please stop that , this feature was always there"
umJbhJRe67I,It's like a whipped cream cake with extra whipped cream on top🎂; ofcourse it's expensive 😄
umJbhJRe67I,Wtf I phone are expensive 🫰 too
umJbhJRe67I,Hottie
umJbhJRe67I,The screen is so disappointing
umJbhJRe67I,This phone is bs
umJbhJRe67I,"Forget about the phone, i found you attractive 🤭🤩🤩"
umJbhJRe67I,You won't like paying for it very expensive.  Very
umJbhJRe67I,Apple is better

IajedKzp9bM,Love watching videos of things I can't afford 🙃
IajedKzp9bM,"Cant wait to upgrade my s10 to the s24 ultra 

You""ll be missed soldier 😭"
IajedKzp9bM,I just upgraded from the s21 ultra and i absolutely love this phone so far. Its a beast
IajedKzp9bM,"That's crazy. Putting the microphone right next to the sim ejector hole. Evil, samsung. And that's why I'm getting one"
IajedKzp9bM,"I am in love with not having a curved edge screen. The biggest pain in the ass with the S21 ultra I had was that if you didn't perfectly center the tempered glass protector around the curve, you'd see it and feel it every time you touched the phone. Flat screens give just a little more leeway with centering on screen protectors"
IajedKzp9bM,"""Make sure u poke the right hole."" The story of my life. 😂"
IajedKzp9bM,"Thankgod I purchased the s24 ultra. It's legit the best thing. I've used the 15 pro max, but it can't come close to the galaxy s24 ultra"
IajedKzp9bM,"This isn't Samsung's most expensive device, that title goes to the fold. The back glass is Victus 2, only the front glass is Armor."
IajedKzp9bM,The quality of this video is *chef's kiss* amazingg
IajedKzp9bM,Amazing phone as always samsung did an amazing job on the phones ❤
IajedKzp9bM,just ordered mine excited ;) thumbs up from me for your video
IajedKzp9bM,Mine will receive tomorrow...i got an offer which cost only 820 Dollors here in UAE
IajedKzp9bM,I used to poke the wrong hole when accessing the Sim card all the time.  Id get so mad at myself.  I did read awhile back that Samsung made the speaker hole more narrow deeper inside to avoid damage!!  Thankfully.  Odd setup.
IajedKzp9bM,Watching on my S24 ultra 😀
IajedKzp9bM,I 💜 Samsung!
IajedKzp9bM,"Hopefully Samsung will make the S25 with atleast 5500mah for more battery or even better 6,000mah for it to be the king of all phones, faster wired and wireless and better AI"
IajedKzp9bM,"I bought the S 24 Ultra last week, and I love it!
I came from S22 Ultra, and that's a great phone itself, but the  S24 Ultra is at another level.
The sound on the S24 Ultra is incredible.   It has some bass to it.  It gives it even more of an elite phone type."
IajedKzp9bM,"Great addition that you can change the screen resolution in most samsung phones, a big PRO."
IajedKzp9bM,Still rockin' mine almost a full year and won't be upgrading for a change🙃 still keeping it for at least another 6 months - a year
IajedKzp9bM,I am planning to buy in August
IajedKzp9bM,S25 ultra was disappointed they removed Bluetooth function thats why i didn't get that phone got s24 ultra instead
IajedKzp9bM,"4:26,

The Titanium Gray Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra appears more yellow in the tint than the Natural Titanium iPhone 15 Pro Max.

From now on, Wait for the iPhone 16 Pro models to come with the new color options including Gray Titanium (with the color shifting of light silver and dark gold) and Yellow Titanium (with the color shifting of light yellow gold and dark amber yellow) to replace the last year's Natural Titanium and White Titanium color options.

Additionally,

The Blue Titanium color option will be replaced by the Purple Titanium color option for retaining the purple color from last two years."
IajedKzp9bM,Switched Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra ; went from 6.9 in to 6.8 in
IajedKzp9bM,Wish I had this phone too bad I'm too broke smh it's beautiful and amazing
IajedKzp9bM,Yes I think that is going to be the one for me it's nice and sleek and I like how the screen is nice and flat
IajedKzp9bM,Great video❤
IajedKzp9bM,This might be the first time I choose the ultra
IajedKzp9bM,suggest me honestly for video recording should i buy this or any iphone
IajedKzp9bM,I'M WATCHING YOU ON S25 ULTRA TITANIUM BLACK ✨💪❤️💯
IajedKzp9bM,Really enjoying the S24U so far 👌
IajedKzp9bM,"Wade, this year Google Fi did the same insane 50% discount promo as last year, just keeping service active for 4 months and that's it!"
IajedKzp9bM,I like it very much. The phone that i have always wanted. Using it always with excitement.
IajedKzp9bM,Very much value for money as conpare to an iphone 15 pro max
IajedKzp9bM,"And you know what..?
They didn't even ASK us if the AI features they put on  these phone were ones that WE want to use or see on the phone in the first place!
Like would it kill them to put out a questionnaire for us to fill out or something?!
That's why I say if and when they pay wall the AI.... Let them do it where if we don't want them... They make a download to take them OFF THE PHONE. Like an app suite that we have to pay for..."
IajedKzp9bM,Nice video man
IajedKzp9bM,Just ordered mine 🎉🎉🎉 switching from Apple
IajedKzp9bM,I wish the titanium boarders would rise slightly above the screen like the apple watch ultra and I hope apple does it as well
IajedKzp9bM,I had a iPhone 13 pro Maxx in upgrade to this phone I miss Samsung had to come back
IajedKzp9bM,I ❤ Samsung. Nice video
IajedKzp9bM,8:23  a hair detected!
IajedKzp9bM,the only reason i skipped the S24U from the S23U was that i didnt need the S Pen. the flat screen got me interested but the S24U is just too big. ended up getting the S24 instead.
IajedKzp9bM,Okok great vid wade
IajedKzp9bM,I love Samsung s24 ultra best phone ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
IajedKzp9bM,7 months later and it's still $1400! Why do they cost so much! 🤦‍♂️ Great review!

IajedKzp9bM,"Samsung makes some of the longest lasting and the best phones imo
I recently got a S21 Fe bcs the price jad droppen a lot after the S24U release,amazing phone still,really excited to get thr S24U series when I can afford it with those 7 years of OS updates lol"
IajedKzp9bM,i wish i had titanium
IajedKzp9bM,They modeled the cameras after a spider.
IajedKzp9bM,Does the Samsung s series do they all come with pre-installed screen protectors because I heard that the s24 ultra does I could be wrong I'm just trying to make sure before I purchase it
IajedKzp9bM,"Strange, my screen doesn't look as bright as yours on the same brightness level. Mines still really dim at around that 40% brightness mark. Yours looks like its at 70%. I wonder if I should get my unit replaced"
IajedKzp9bM,Beautiful design ❤❤
IajedKzp9bM,Is it worth upgrading from iPhone 13 ? 13 normal version.  iPhone is depressing me it looks more and more like a child’s mobile boring design
IajedKzp9bM,"Think that samsung went with the ""titanium"" color Cuz of the way the ACTUAL MINERAL looks... This one has more of a bronze /light goldish tinge to it.....
That's why the colors of Grey, black, green and the other color looks more GREYED OUT than the darker hued colors....
That's what I think anyway, lol"
IajedKzp9bM,Mate I am upgrading from s10plus so this is amazing for me
IajedKzp9bM,After seeing this I'm going to buy the phone or try too at least
IajedKzp9bM,How much is usb cable 3 or 5 amp?
IajedKzp9bM,Anyone else confused by the time of upload?
IajedKzp9bM,"""Agent of Chaos"" 😂 Love it!"
IajedKzp9bM,I was thinking of buying the iphone 16 pro but now I'm thinking of buying the samsung s24 ultra
IajedKzp9bM,Is it worth upgrading from S23 Ultra to 24 Ultra?
IajedKzp9bM,"I recently upgraded from having a Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite man it was soooooo long before I upgraded but finally did! 

I got the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 1TB Unlocked for $1,003.00 thankfully I ordered mine directly from Samsung through their website so glad I got this at this price"
IajedKzp9bM,"Great review. 

Can you do a comparison between samsung a73 5g against a35 5g please 🙏."
IajedKzp9bM,I BOUGHT 4 SAMSUNG GALAXY Z FOLD PHONES AND ALL 4 HAD COMPLAINTS WHEN I UPDATED THE SOFTWARE AND ONE COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING
IajedKzp9bM,Watch from pakistan 🇵🇰 dude
IajedKzp9bM,3:43❤
IajedKzp9bM,"That grey starts looking too yellow in lighting, glad I went for violet"

IajedKzp9bM,Solid
IajedKzp9bM,Coming soon ✨🔜🎉

IajedKzp9bM,i wish had titanium
IajedKzp9bM,"from all the videos it seemed too big but not that big compared to my nokia 5.4,or probably my hands are just big."
IajedKzp9bM,Varient?
IajedKzp9bM,"Do you have display issues in your country also like i am facing. Green lines, white screen, no help from service center? S22 ultra gone, S20+ gone. I have afraid my 23ultra and fold6 will have the same fate"
IajedKzp9bM,Samsung Tech much better than iphone new phone
IajedKzp9bM,I would like to own a Samsung galaxy s24 ultra can you buy me one of the phone please
IajedKzp9bM,Soon Samsung and apple will stop shipping the power cord . You watch.
IajedKzp9bM,❤❤❤❤❤
IajedKzp9bM,How mach? 24 ultra
IajedKzp9bM,I have both the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and may view is as follows:  face ID is poor on the Ultra and the finger print scanner could be better. Other than those two issues the Ultra is a very good phone and is almost on par to the iPhone.
IajedKzp9bM,No charging brick?
XtiLq2Im_p0,To all the S23 users we not missing out much on the S24 no pressure🤟
XtiLq2Im_p0,S23 ultra owner it's no need to upgrade 😂😂😂
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Primary difference is processor speed, you can tell by the lag jumping when zooming with the s23 but the s24 is fairly smooth so i mean if the difference in lag is enough for the price idk"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Not saying that s24 ultra is not capable of it but the zoom on s23 is not bad at all. And I'm certain it'll do better than the image shown in comparison. Using it myself
XtiLq2Im_p0,"S23 ultra best,"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Had the s24 ultra now for a week and im in love 😊
XtiLq2Im_p0,"""They're the same picture.""

- Pam"
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Samsung
S23 ultra
one & only
King.👑👑"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Your hand wasn’t steady when taking the shot from the s23 ultra
XtiLq2Im_p0,"I have both right now.  The s24Us display just made every other phones display obsolete. It's a world of difference vs the s23U. Not everything is about the cameras. This display is world class, absolute game changer!"
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Old is gold 
Team s23 ultra
👇"
XtiLq2Im_p0,still rocking a galaxy s6 🔥
XtiLq2Im_p0,It is really funny to see a comment section that talking about which phone is better
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Wah! S24 Ultra ka zoom dekh ke maza aa gaya 🔥
Maine bhi ek zoom test kiya hai – kaafi crazy result mila 😲"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Apple: we add new button 🎉🎉
XtiLq2Im_p0,"s24 ultra have better video 4K 120 fps, s23 ultra only 4K 60fps.That’s was a point!!! A smooth video"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Props to the camera woman taking that photo while riding on a mechanical bull.
XtiLq2Im_p0,This is what I imagine phones would be like in Minecraft.
XtiLq2Im_p0,3 year ago i was suffering from using vivo y21 and today i have the samsung s22 ultra
XtiLq2Im_p0,"""can your Apple do that"""
XtiLq2Im_p0,She call us poor in many way🗿
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Idc if it's better or worse they did something good and that's making the 3x to 10x gap smaller. If i had one I'd probably zoom to 100x around family and friends to just show it to them, its not useful the most zoom people gon need is probably 50x"
XtiLq2Im_p0,S23U user + savings. End of discussion
XtiLq2Im_p0,I shoot all my videos on the s23 and i wonder how the s24 would be different for that.  Not sure anyone would know.
XtiLq2Im_p0,What resolution did you use?
XtiLq2Im_p0,"S23 Ultra:🌳
S24 Ultra:🌳"
XtiLq2Im_p0,"For those who keep saying that s23 is sharper blaa blaa blaa, are you guys blind or what? Can't you see the s24 ultra displaying the near to actual surface texture more realistically?
S24 ultra has new SD3, 7 years of updates newer model better optimization it's always worth it to upgrade as long as you get a good trade in and benefits"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Imagina daqui 10 anos teremos um telescópio
XtiLq2Im_p0,100x is overrated… the pics are unusable. Unless you take pic of moon which is enhanced by ai
XtiLq2Im_p0,which song ?? i couldn't find this version
XtiLq2Im_p0,My current phone can do 8x zoom only. 😂
XtiLq2Im_p0,"So im thinking of buying a Samsung S25 ultra or the samsung s24 ultra, im just using it for daily life, nothing fancy. Which  one should i get for that?"
XtiLq2Im_p0,I like her hands
XtiLq2Im_p0,I thought the pic of S24 ultra in the top of the water tank is the middle finger.
XtiLq2Im_p0,Is it lens zoom or digital zoom?
XtiLq2Im_p0,Thank god i looked in the comments
XtiLq2Im_p0,"100x is too much, both pictures are equally bad. S24 looks _slightly_ sharper, not saying that it looks any better though"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Only zooming everytime in each video 😂
XtiLq2Im_p0,Galaxy S23 Ultra and Galaxy S24 ultra Ultra known as Galaxy Sniper23 Ultra and Galaxy Sniper24 Ultra and i still believe that in 2050 it will be just Galaxy S50 Ultra and imagine the zoom would be like 500x lol
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Godddd, I need one 😭🙏🏾"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Galaxy S99 Ultra Zoom: ☀️🌕⭐️🌀🪐🌠
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Iswtg your hands make that phone look ginormous than it actually is 😅,, all in all though great comparison 10/10.. good choice of the shot as well 👏🏾"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Ik ga voor s23 ultra om dat goedkoper is
XtiLq2Im_p0,Isn’t that the haunted hotel? with the water tower that someone died in?
XtiLq2Im_p0,"I’m trying out the iPhone, I didnt even know there was that on top of the building"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Same Same But Different 😊
XtiLq2Im_p0,Background music name ?
XtiLq2Im_p0,"iphone camera: 100x
Snapchat Camera: 1000000000000000000000000000000x"
XtiLq2Im_p0,I couldn’t tell the difference between both of these phones. Which is which?
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Changes on iphone and samsung
Samsung:changes there size
iPhone:changes there camera size💀"
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Sadly, you can not use 200mp or 108mp on 100x zoom"
XtiLq2Im_p0,The S23 Ultra is better than the S24 Ultra.
XtiLq2Im_p0,Same Imo no need to upgrade
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Still using my S22 Ultra, I might upgrade next year."
XtiLq2Im_p0,People watching this in 2025? 👇
XtiLq2Im_p0,"iPhone Vs Samsung❌ 
Samsung Vs Samsung✅"
XtiLq2Im_p0,One plus 13 💀 (no offence to samsung)
XtiLq2Im_p0,You can't say S24 is better from this photo.
XtiLq2Im_p0,The A8 galaxy 🔥🔥
XtiLq2Im_p0,The difference isn't just zoom alone s23 users
XtiLq2Im_p0,Samsung : Performance.            IPhone : Aesthetics
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Both of them are better than an iPhone.Watch.Apparently get an upgrade in camera every single time.Apparently , and yet this one , both of them are better than a iphone"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Song name.?????
XtiLq2Im_p0,SAMSUNG S24 ULTRA 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
XtiLq2Im_p0,"pra quem ja tem o S23 ultra pode ficar tranquilo com ele, pra quem nao tem e vai comprar um novo, obvio que deve pegar o S24 ultra que é melhor em tudo, até no superzoom que seria o ponto forte do S23u, o S24u ganha devido sua abertura de sensor ser bem maior e tem 5x mais pixels nele. tirando isso,  todo o resto do celular é melhor que o s23u, autonomia, atualização, acabamento, processador, tela..."
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Samsung ❌️
Zoomsung✅️"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Watching this video from S25 Ultra
XtiLq2Im_p0,Who is meditating there
XtiLq2Im_p0,❤Love you all the best to you
XtiLq2Im_p0,"About the same, slightly less grainy on s24"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Watching this vedio in s24 ultra
XtiLq2Im_p0,You know why they always pay these companies to do the 100x? Cause its gonna look crap on both. Do 10x video test at night to see what you lost.
XtiLq2Im_p0,Love the water tower great video
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Sorry but cant see any differences, thank you for sharing"
XtiLq2Im_p0,Turn off ai processing and try again. I bet S23 ultra wins
XtiLq2Im_p0,still rocking a A50🥶
XtiLq2Im_p0,same
XtiLq2Im_p0,S23❤
XtiLq2Im_p0,Samsung Galaxy is extraordinary😊❤
XtiLq2Im_p0,Almost same but s23 is tiny dark photo
XtiLq2Im_p0,Music name por favor?
XtiLq2Im_p0,So nobody noticed that she is using only 12 mp?
XtiLq2Im_p0,the same camera but different hardware
XtiLq2Im_p0,Samsung galaxy s23 ultra is a beast
XtiLq2Im_p0,Bro put it on 200mp 😅
XtiLq2Im_p0,I have s23 ultra my dad have s24 ultra
XtiLq2Im_p0,Am waiting for S338 ultra 🤒
XtiLq2Im_p0,Who sings this song? Whats the name of the female singer please
XtiLq2Im_p0,De que adianta um baita zoom mas a foto  sem resolução?
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Don't believe all these reviewers. I have the 23 Galaxy. And the 24 and I will say there is a big difference. Especially night photos. Aside from the camera, there are a lot of other upgrades at the twenty three doesn't have"
XtiLq2Im_p0,S23 ultra its best❤❤❤❤
XtiLq2Im_p0,Why did i see a middle finger .
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Iphone 16❌

XtiLq2Im_p0,That phone is massive or you're hands are small
XtiLq2Im_p0,Samsung s23 ultra 🎉❤❤❤🎉❤❤
XtiLq2Im_p0,I’m still on my IPhone 12 but Samsung left behind everyone.
XtiLq2Im_p0,"Mi pregunta ,Tanto vamos a  el zoom 😊"

nyxcO2vdcCg,Funny how the S25 is back to scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7... This was just too good for them
nyxcO2vdcCg,Just switched (like an hour ago) to an s24 ultra from exclusively having an iPhone. Something just felt different about Samsung this year and I had to see for myself. I am way too pleased with the tiny pen that lives inside my phone now
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I just got my s24 ultra yesterday. And the screen clarity on this thing is absolutely insane. I have had a note series phone since the two and the 10 plus I had for 4 years and actually love that phone. I only upgraded to the fold4 last year after they killed off the note series and I wanted to get the newest 5G capabilities and not just the ultra wide 5G that the Note 10 plus 5G came with. But I found myself using the front small screen more often than taking the time to open up the phone to use it and really only used it to watch movies or shows. And since the ultra line took back where the note left that big gaping hole in the Samsung lineup I decided to jump back and get the 24 ultra. Where with trading in my fold4, getting a pre-order discount, and another $150 off coupon on top of it, and the 512 GB matching for the same price as the 256, I got mine delivered for just a hair over $700. It also came with case and screen protector and I got the Samsung buds pro 2 for free with it as well. So all in all not a bad deal for all that for that price."
nyxcO2vdcCg,"For the S24 Ultra, as nice and durable the tiranium frame is, the anti reflective screen is the upgrade that stood out for me, as it won’t glare like other phone screens especially when using it under the direct sun. The level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8 is beyond what I have imagined ❤"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"S25U just got released
we re downgraded to SCRATCHES AT LEVEL 6, DEEPER GROOVES AT LEVEL 7 :("
nyxcO2vdcCg,Samsung really changed the game this time around. Scratches at level 7 and deeper groves at level 8 is an amazing feat.
nyxcO2vdcCg,I saw a video by PBK Reviews who did the Mohs test first and he also got very unnoticeable scratches at 7 and major scratches at 8. I've been waiting for Zak's video to confirm this and it's amazing it does confirm it!
nyxcO2vdcCg,Fun fact: The 'capacitor' in the s-pen is actually a Lithium Titanate  (LTO) Battery made by Nichicon. This is in reference to @5:07. Interesting stuff and something I learned at CES!
nyxcO2vdcCg,"3:48 aged like milk, it's back to being the same with s25 XD"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I don't think adding titanium to smartphones was a good idea, the lack of flexibility is very bad when it comes to absorbing impact."
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I just got the s24 ultra 1TB after upgrading from my note 10 plus of 4 years. Even though my old note 10 plus is still working well, this was definitely a huge upgrade that is well appreciated!"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"Omg, had to pause the video to express the shock that scratches appear on level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8! I was waiting a long time for this moment!!!"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"He projects Dexter serial killer vibe, amazing video 🤝"
nyxcO2vdcCg,This phone has made history with the scratch test 😂
nyxcO2vdcCg,"Technology has evolved because 
Jerry has said ""scratches at level 7, with deeper Groves at level 8"""
nyxcO2vdcCg,"Here I am looking for reviews on the ultra (the phone I just purchased) not realizing that I would find something much better. The reckless abandon in this video is top notch and seeing someone deface a $1300 product like it was nothing, did something for me. Going to sub. Keep up the excellent work."
nyxcO2vdcCg,And they downgraded the legendary scratches at level 7 and deeper groves at level 8.
nyxcO2vdcCg,"What a glorious moment to be the first to witness ""scratches at level 7, with deeper grooves at level 8"" after how many years subscribed to this channel! 😅"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"Am I the only one who got goosebumps😮when Zack said ""Things will never be the same"" ?"
nyxcO2vdcCg,The durablity test is here finally !
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I think the last time I was here was at the iPhone XS Max release and I've been watching before the crossover episode with WhatsInside was aired.

I came back after I heard rumors that there's now a glass that scratches at level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8 and boy did I get one hell of a nostalgic hit.

Zack, I can't express how happy I am to see how big your channel's grown and couldn't say anything short of well-deserved. Hope we both live long enough to witness you reaching scratches at level 9 with deeper grooves at level 10."
nyxcO2vdcCg,Wow. Scratches at a level 7 with deeper grooves at a level 8. Incredible.
nyxcO2vdcCg,"0:03 Everyone pointing out 2017 Essential phone, but forget Nokia 8910 existed in 2002."
nyxcO2vdcCg,5:00 this is the only time i felt the pain
nyxcO2vdcCg,These videos hurt my soul lol ...but glad someone does these tests
nyxcO2vdcCg,Anti-glare and scratches starting from level 7 and deepening at level 8 is actually legendary
nyxcO2vdcCg,Dear Note 9 we have been together for almost five years & you been good to me. We traveled around the world multiple times. We close many deals together and because of you I was able to stay in contact with many new friends and family from around the world. Did many video calls and got closer to people emotionally because of you.  You were definitely there when I needed you the most. Time to upgrade to S24 Ultra and i see you will arrive today.  Will miss you note 9. ♥🙏♥🙏
nyxcO2vdcCg,I love these videos and have been watching them for years. And I will never get over the metal scrapping sounds. I have to skip it every time. 😂
nyxcO2vdcCg,4:42 Did he just say S23 Ultra?
nyxcO2vdcCg,"2:40
🗣Mom, bring the calendar!!!"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I've been using the Note line up for 10+ years. Note 3, Note 7, Note 9 and Note 10+. I did not want to upgrade because my Note 10+ is still rocking. But for work and school, the features, build quality and performance upgrade that the 24 Ultra offers is making me consider to upgrade. Great video ! 😎"
nyxcO2vdcCg,I just bought the 24 ultra then saw your video. I was on the edge of my seat through your review! Now i feel happy with my purchase......just have to wait for delivery. 😢
nyxcO2vdcCg,"If you can scratch a S24 ultra, you are definitly rich xd"
nyxcO2vdcCg,The Gorilla Glass engineering team was surely holding their breath for this one!
nyxcO2vdcCg,First time I got an Ultra phone from Samsung. And I can see it's worth it this year. I like how all phone manufacturers are going for long OS support and more durable builds. Less chances of me needing to repair my phone.
nyxcO2vdcCg,The only review I need is from this channel. I cannot believe we heard a different scratch resistance level!
nyxcO2vdcCg,Had this in my pocket for 1 day with no screen protector and got a scratched screen now
nyxcO2vdcCg,"""Scratches at a level 7, with deeper grooves at a level 8.""

Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him."
nyxcO2vdcCg,Hearing “deeper grooves at level 8” is a historical moment
nyxcO2vdcCg,"My God, hearing ""scratches at level 7, with deeper grooves at level 8"" gave me goosebumps! Amazing!"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"Sad story, but here goes, Bought this phone on a third-party app. Was extremely excited that I finally could get a sweet phone and get away from this dumb iPhone. Well, I shouldn't have done that. Lost my money to a phone locked in someone's name. The carrier won't/can't help either. Smh end story. On the other hand, this phone is absolutely amazing. The quality in the pictures is outstanding. It's fast durable and fits perfectly in my hand. I will save up to get one from a retail store for sure, but it may take a second. Sorry for the sob story. Love your content. Keep up the great work!!!"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I love that moment with the scratches at level 7, it's been such a long time building to it"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I’m beyond shocked by the “scratches at level 7, deeper grooves at level 8” bit. 
It feels like when someone breaks a major time-barrier in a popular speedrun."
nyxcO2vdcCg,THE HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE AND I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS. from a Samsung phone?? never i was just here for a bit of Jerry's sarcasm and ocassional asmr test that is just relaxing bit when i saw and heard scratches at a level 7 and deeper grooves at lever 8 i was SHOCKED cuz it aint even sapphire And i just can't explain. nothing will be same and i literally need anyone to share my excitement with.
nyxcO2vdcCg,"""Scratches only begin at level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8""... What a moment 3:44"
nyxcO2vdcCg,7:26 he put the open flip 5 to the pile of tools like nothing bad would happen to that screen
nyxcO2vdcCg,I was having a little buyers remorse upgrading my note 20U to the 24U. But this video alone supports my decision. Ty Jerry.
nyxcO2vdcCg,R.I.P 🪦 Scraches at level 6 and Deeper grooves at level 7 thanks for all these years of perfection 😢
nyxcO2vdcCg,7:55 😂😂😂this is why I'll forever stay subscribed
nyxcO2vdcCg,"Perfect timing 🎉
Waiting for teardown 
Have to check the titanium and vapour chamber cooling setup"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"When he just casually broke the S-Pen... that hurt me inside 😢 Poor S-Pen, you didn't deserve that!"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"I was actually about to cry when he said “Scratches at a level 7, with deeper grooves on a level 8.”
Was not expecting that fr 😭
It’s a big day bros! He said the thing we were waiting for!!🎉"
nyxcO2vdcCg,"IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!! ""Scratches at a level 7 with with deeper grooves at a level 8"" I NEVER THOUGHT THIS DAY WOULD COME!! 🤯🤯🤯"

xr8CpY3tM8U,as a samsung fan i know iphone one of the best phone for gaming and the gaming experience and also stability of iphone better than all andoid but i ❤ andoid phones .for example new andoid works good but old iphone works like a new android .but i respect both andoid 🤝apple ❤❤❤
xr8CpY3tM8U,animations on iphone are so beautiful
xr8CpY3tM8U,Bro They need to add fast charging on iPhone and galaxy phones 100 watt
xr8CpY3tM8U,"S24 Ultra is the best, Hope i can get one, Must have a stylus tho."
xr8CpY3tM8U,"Ahhh yes , that 1 millisecond difference is gonna save the world 💀💀💀"
xr8CpY3tM8U,"Everyone at the moment: ""wait for the next generation of the phone""
Are you serious?
If you read articles you would know they won't bring any innovative components and accessories until the next 3-4 years, how does research work on your opinion? for what they are called top of the range, they won't bring something even better, research requires a lot of funds and investments. Stop filling the comments with idiotic stuff. Also, stop the contests between iPhone and Samsung, Samsung brought more innovation these years. Maybe iPhone will be in the next decade. That's how competition in the marketplace works."
xr8CpY3tM8U,Hahah i am thinking of selling my iPhone 15 pro max and buying 24 ultra 😂
xr8CpY3tM8U,"16:44 it wasn’t even his idea, it was Jeremy Zag’s (while Thomas was in vacation, Jeremy wrote the show)"
xr8CpY3tM8U,"Both are great phones. The processor performance on both is the same. If you say the Snapdragon 3rd gen is better for gaming, the A17 Pro Bionics can also handle any demanding game smoothly. The same applies to intensive video editing and rendering tasks. You need to check multiple sources to gain insight into that. 

In daily use, you won't even notice the difference. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. The sole disparity lies in our biased mindset."
xr8CpY3tM8U,Nav bar for the Samsung Galaxy device please
xr8CpY3tM8U,Doesn’t matter who is fast. Stability upon time matters as a gamers perspective. There is not a single gamer in the world who will choose samsung s24 ultra upon iPhone cause iphone have best stability every known to phones.
xr8CpY3tM8U,Its A tie because they open at the same time and youtube on the iphone 15 pro max just has a intro
xr8CpY3tM8U,"Be cool if you were to show us your task  launcher and prove that you don’t have the apps already loaded on the s24u vs iPhone 15PM launching from a cold start - I’ve got both phones and will do the same test this evening. Film it too - as well, I can show you identical apps (X-Plane & Aerofly FS World), very taxing amps with user control over graphic performance - where the s24 ultra can’t maintain 30fps (dropping as low as 12-14fps in populated areas and/or cockpit controls) - while the iPhone, same settings, doesn’t drop below 57-58fps, regardless of the terrain or the drawing of instrumentation and real time mapping on a glass cockpit. Even has a difficult time with steam gauge SuperCubs and 15/172s! 

I love both for different reasons, and I can show you the fact the S24 Ultra will NOT allow the use of Google Drive and/or Photos as a default repository for media or backing up your phone. The ONLY option is OneDrive! I’ve owned every iPhone since 2007, and along with them, I purchased an Android phone - initially, Notes 1, 2, 4, & 5 - I switched to Pixels, back to Sammy, and took a couple year break, until the S21/iPhone 11. This, even though the 11’s had the power and efficiency in the chip, the 21 was a better choice in my opinion. That opinion changed with 12 - 15 (I have 15PM and 24u, no 16/25) and the ridiculous redundancy of EVERY mandatory smartphone app; calendars, phones, messaging, notes, wallets, stores, calculators, voice recorders, contacts, clocks, ‘internet’, reminders, find my apps, and I’ve likely forgotten a dozen - but the ones I named ALL have the option to use the Samsung or Google version of the keyboard (one I forgot) as the default keyboard 
Unfortunately, and as ubiquitous as Google Drive/Photos (2 apps Mt View hasn’t abandoned) have been the last decade, as well as they’ve worked cross platform - whether WIndows or macOS, iOS, Android or iPadOS, Drive and Photos are arguably as good or better file managers than others’ native apps. Like Sammy’s Gallery! Who’s EVER used it other than Samsung SXX users? Or Galaxy tabs or laptops? Those are the ONLY three things capable of accessing your Samsung Gallery
EVERY other Android phone or tablet - including Samsung, has allowed Google Photos as your repository for stills and motion, Drive for audio and docs spreadsheets etc. No longer.

NOW if you want your pictures backed up you HAVE to have a subscription for MS365, which includes OneDrive, the ONLY option for photo backup (& video and everything else on your phone) able to be used other than a local SSD, same that you can do on iPhone - however, I can choose Chrome as my default browser on iPhone - Google Maps as my default mapping app, or G-Mail, Drive, Photos, everything is an option on Apple’s products.

The fact Samsung has 
A) dropped support for Photos and
B) done the same with Drive is over the top, and IMO, a purchase killer. Period

As a subscriber already of MS365 pre-s24u purchase, I’d have returned it, as you’re looking at an extra $120 a year to store your photos in the cloud, instead of the tiers of Google storage sizes.
This is my biggest complaint about the Samsung phones but followed closely by a few dozen redundant apps that Samsung copies Google’s and other’s to use open code software as a foundation for ONE UI, the crappiest OS on mobile in existence. Even though G-Board eats storage, the Samsung keyboard’s a joke.

I will say, the ONLY two things I’ve found preferable on the s24U vs the iPhone are the display (but ‘just’ as both are stellar) and the lack of almost ANY software I use 90% of the time on iOS and iPadOS - from incredible cameras for both stills and video, Timelapse and celestial - Play Store options are a joke in comparison… and audio production; from Digital Audio Workstations AKA DAWs to synths, percussion, wave editing and simple recording apps with multitrack abilities that are essential for prosecution. 
Why a positive? I don’t  have to buy them again!
Display, a slight edge, otherwise, I guess - and I’ve tried, I’m not a phone customizer guy. The themes and goofy fonts, the single colors or gradients, and the need to feel unique or different doesn’t appeal to me at all, and wile the ultrasonic finger print reader is amazing, it also sucks trying to land it correctly first try… where is the iPhone or iPad w/Face ID work instantly, battery life are near parity, my 15PM might have a slight edge, especially if gaming. And Microsoft and Adobe have MUCH better performance and capability, as well as apps - period - on iOS. While Docs and Sheets work okay, they don’t compare to the MS Suite, not even Apple’s Office suite - and messaging? What a S&%T Show! 
iMessage is so far ahead of either Goog or Sam’s messaging - and anyone older than 30’s not ‘Snapping’ - and unless you’re a fan of illegal communication, Signal and the rest don’t hold a candle to iMessage’s continuity with all Apple products one has; Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, Car Play, Home Pods, Air Pods, vertical and horizontal integration is definitely a massive plus, even though Samsung’s doing their best to jump in the sack with Windows, using connect to Windows, OneDrive as only option to backup - they’d be better off developing, from scratch, without the 30 years of x86 cruft built on cruft so you can still run that ‘legacy’ software that’s not been updated since last millennium - Samsung could easily take a couple years to write a decent third OS, without the Android Open Source code or the foundation of Windows 11’s nightmares… instead building better continuity between ALL devices - opening their market up significantly (and giving their customers back a dozen gigs of memory while eliminating the Google apps you can’t use!)"
xr8CpY3tM8U,"do not compare iphone 15 pro max with S24 ultra, try it with S 22 ultra, 24 ultra is 2 years ahead of iphone 😊😊"
xr8CpY3tM8U,"Which is more reliable for long year use? For 4yrs uasge which is more reliable?? Myself got s21 ultra bought at 2021 Nov nd today in Jan 2025 it got green line on screen out of nowhere (no dropped, nothing) should i buy apple 16pro max or s25 ultra for reliability? Pls help🙏"

xr8CpY3tM8U,Apple doesn’t focus on the app opening speed it just focuses on the cpu and gpu
xr8CpY3tM8U,For your info iPhone is made for cool animations in opening and closing not for speed test so apple opening closing spec is more satisfying in reality iPhone says that and Samsung also know
xr8CpY3tM8U,but which phone are you recording with this video ? Samsung or Iphone ?

xr8CpY3tM8U,Samsung S24 really cooked iPhone this year
xr8CpY3tM8U,It's kinda sad the s24 even hangs with  iPhone considering how light and basic iOS is. There's a lot more that's being processed with Android OS
xr8CpY3tM8U,"Samsung has good loading nice camera quality, but in general it just doesn’t feel smooth, and Apple has these little touches of smoothness to the phone, and just modern and simple things that makes it better. If you’re someone who loves cameras photos and everything then sure maybe the Samsung is for u, if you’re just an Apple fan and you like smooths phone , and good camera quality just can’t zoom far, get an iPhone."
xr8CpY3tM8U,We cannot compare google apps on a phone that has google software tbh

ZCRPfo-md90,Pulling the sticker from the phone screen is the best part
ZCRPfo-md90,"They should offer, curved display AND flat display options, that flat screen looks like from the 2010's"
ZCRPfo-md90,Dream phone 😤
ZCRPfo-md90,wow...  even the camera is good ❤
ZCRPfo-md90,Im getting the same phone with same color in 2 weeks im hyped
ZCRPfo-md90,🎉 great video presentation I love the Samsung Galaxy product style lines and grey sleek color is 😎!
ZCRPfo-md90,I unboxed the same colour variant it was the most satisfying thing in the world ❤ love my  s24 ultra taitamum ❤
ZCRPfo-md90,You have to get a special screen protector to take advantage of the new type of glass that prevents reflective glare. If you use an ordinary protector you will lose the benefit of the new glare resistant glass. The special protector costs about $30.
ZCRPfo-md90,If you buy one make sure you have a USB C charger or you buy one before hand. For whatever reason they don't give you one in the box. Just the cord. But you'll need both the part that plugs into the phone and the part that plugs into the wall to be USB C.
ZCRPfo-md90,"Wooow que padre se ve,yo aquí viéndolo desde mi S3 mini🤗
Algun día me comprare ese❤"
ZCRPfo-md90,My dream phone S24 ultra♥️
ZCRPfo-md90,Watching on my S24 Ultra Titanium Gray🤩
ZCRPfo-md90,It's an awesome phone. Just be sure you disable Google Gemini. Google assistant is much better if you want routines and you want to be able to turn your lights on and off.
ZCRPfo-md90,The real OG 🔥😍
ZCRPfo-md90,"I dont see the phone was distracted on the gold ring, so nice 😂"
ZCRPfo-md90,You made me switch from 15 pm to s24 ultra
ZCRPfo-md90,Nice phone having AI features. I'm using it almost 3 months. Wonderful camera. Brilliant look. 😊Love it
ZCRPfo-md90,Love it ❤🎉

ZCRPfo-md90,I got mine Saturday 😂so happy
ZCRPfo-md90,I'm using Samsung galaxy S24 very powerful and beautiful phone 📱 and i  love ❤️ it
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I'll choose the S24 Ultra on every single time
It's the most complete phone ever
I hope Samsung respects his users"
TGWvTWtlvZo,Watching on my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra love it!.😊
TGWvTWtlvZo,This was a solid generation along with the S24+
TGWvTWtlvZo,This was their best piece of work.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Bought the s24 ultra 2months ago, and man i love this phone sm"
TGWvTWtlvZo,I'm keeping my S24 Ultra until its not supported anymore. Love it!
TGWvTWtlvZo,i was chosen between s24 ultra and s25 ultra and I chose s24 ultra and I didn't regret
TGWvTWtlvZo,Got my update about 4 days ago. With no problems.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"My strategy was wait for the S25U to release , then wait a month or two for the price drop!
Got my S24U a month ago and I'm not having any regrets 👌
Absolute banger of a phone 👍"
TGWvTWtlvZo,5-31-25 I just bought this on Amazon for $700 refurbished. I'm very happy with it.
TGWvTWtlvZo,Watching on mine with OneUI 7-- got it before the rollout was halted and I have had no issues period. This is still very much an excellent device one year later
TGWvTWtlvZo,insanely good phone  still. my s21 ultra still performs great to this day with only a slight battery life toll shows these newer phones can last along time compared to 1gb ram iphone 5s days
TGWvTWtlvZo,literally was gonna buy this phone in couple of days 😅❤
TGWvTWtlvZo,It's been 10 months I bought this phone. And I love it so much 💕
TGWvTWtlvZo,My Samsung S24 Ultra feels like new after this upgrade. It was not just an update but an upgrade. Battery life is great.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"With S24 ultra, Samsung was at its peak !"
TGWvTWtlvZo,Bought it last October after 15 years with iPhone. Love it!
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I do wish they offered the exact same phone with the exact same features around 6.1”-6.3"" like the iPhone Pro, basically the same size as regular the s24/25."
TGWvTWtlvZo,Got my S24U enterprise edition this month only.. 3 years of warranty ADLD etc for such a low price was a steal deal. Upgraded it from my 1.5y old 23U
TGWvTWtlvZo,Bought mine about a week after launch and it is definitely my all time favorite phone.  A year and half later it's still my all time favorite.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I wasn''t even a Samsung user until I saw this beast and fell in love. The sharp corners, the flat big screen, the titanium frame, the perfectly symmetrical edges around the screen... in a market where 90% of phones look exactly the same, this one really stood out as unique with a very premium symmetrical feel. Too bad that Samsung opted to go ""mainstream"" with the S25U by making it another generic bar-shaped phone :("
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I absolutely love it. I slapped an Otterbox defender commuter    series  case on mine, and it seems even bigger. I love my ultra phone with some heft"
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Perfect timing for the video! I’m seeing some excellent deals on the S24 ultra I’m considering upgrading from my iPhone 13 Pro Max, but i’m a little bit nervous when it comes to transferring all of my data only because I’m worried that some things might not get transferred perfectly."
TGWvTWtlvZo,Just upgraded from S22 Ultra to S24 Ultra 1tb. Fantastic phone. Didn't want s25 Ultra.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I bought it for 7000 swedish mint condition:) yellow titanium gold , from a hobby user"
TGWvTWtlvZo,"im gonna buy one this summer, i have redmi note 11 pro and Its perfect but i miss samsung, my first ever phone was Samsung S4 galaxy. and now i will have S24 galaxy"
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I switched to iPhone couple years ago, not a day goes by where I regret it. In samsung I had dozens of websites and apps to download movies and musics for free with no issues whatsoever but now I pay for music apps, multiple streaming apps, cant download anything online. I was looking around which phone to get and this one seems like the winner. Looking very much forward to buying it."
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I bought it three weeks ago
No regrets
It's a wonderful purchase❤"
TGWvTWtlvZo,I have an S24 Ultra 1tb and skipped the S25 Ultra this year due to the minor upgrades. The trade-in incentive was not good enough as well. The One UI 7.0 update made the S24 Ultra feel fresh and is now practically 90% of what the S25 Ultra is. I hope the Z Fold7 offers more significant upgrades over the Z Fold6 for me to justify an upgrade and trade-in this year.
TGWvTWtlvZo,I just switched from iphone 13 pro max to samsung s24 ultra . Its just really amazing ❤
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Greetings from Europe 
I love my s24ultra it is the best phone I ever bought.
Not in a hurry to change."
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I've always owned Samsung phones. My last was a galaxy A42 I had for a few years. I only quit using it because I got weld spatter on the screen that burned a few holes then cracks starting forming around them. Switched to a Google pixel 8 which I like but I keep getting the ""green screen of death"" on two different phones. So I ordered a s24. Hopefully it's as reliable as my old A42."
TGWvTWtlvZo,S24 Ultra ❤❤
TGWvTWtlvZo,Currently using the s24 ultra and all I can say is that it is the best phone out of all other phones I have used
TGWvTWtlvZo,Definitely a bargain to enjoy - and you'll even regain Bluetooth capability on the S Pen 😊
TGWvTWtlvZo,"S22 Ultra, S23 ultra, S24 Ultra, and last S25 Ultra....back to back 4 king of smartphone 🗿"
TGWvTWtlvZo,Still a beast of a phone after year later... so snappy... battery last for days... samsung really did it for this one... thats why people think the S25 ULTRA was a downgrade...
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I'm so glad you made a video about this in current year, it's such a beautiful premium phone"
TGWvTWtlvZo,"A few hiccups here and there, but still an amazing phone over a year later."
TGWvTWtlvZo,YAAAAAS! This is still the best device ever. I'm so happy I kept and held on to mine.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"As an Apple user since 9 years almost buying each and every device since then. I hate to admit it, that my iPhone 16 will  have to get sold pretty soon cuz s24 ultra has the 120hz ( which i am not getting even after paying a very decent prize ), it has a better display and battery. However, i believe that the 100x zoom is of no use to me, but overall it is sensational."
TGWvTWtlvZo,I have the s24 ultra and the s25 ultra. Besides the 8 gen 3 processor and the camera specs vs the s25 ultra its the best phone. The processor and camera is still fast and good. One ui 7 enhanced it and the s24 ultra is a straight demon 😈.
TGWvTWtlvZo,Well it definitely looks better than the S25 Ultra.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I had the S22 Ultra and just upgraded to the S25 Ultra and I dont regret it at all, even happy I made the upgrade. It's super fast and reliable and does everything much better than that. I dont mind the more rounded look as it does feel a bit different but also feeling familiar in a way. Even if I didnt like the design I think the performance would be enough for me."
TGWvTWtlvZo,Another excellent video Nick! Do you have an unlocked version or the AT&T variant? And how is your battery life after the One UI 7 update compared when it was on the previous One UI version?
TGWvTWtlvZo,I'm still glad I upgraded to the 25 ultra i see why people needed to adjust to it that got it tho
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I got the s24 ultra, and I don't even consider the s25. I like the sharp edges, the bluetooth s-pen, and with one ui 7 it's literally the best for me. I also use it without a case, and it has almost no damage on it."
TGWvTWtlvZo,I am so glad I switched carriers when I did and decided on the S24 Ultra. I think I'm going to keep the S24 Ultra until it dies or stops updating. I even have the plan to upgrade every year (once the phone is 50% paid off). I may be changing my plan soon to maybe save some money but it might only be a few dollars a month.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Men i love the unique boxy shape of the S24 ultra, but on the S25 ultra it's GONE 😢😢"
TGWvTWtlvZo,Watching this on my s21 ultra really considering s24 ultra or s23 ultra.
TGWvTWtlvZo,I waited and waited - just bought my new S24 ultra yesterday at a nice price of 955 SGD. Super happy with my choice. Thanks for your video!🤟🤟
TGWvTWtlvZo,I'm watching 👀 on my brand new Samsung S24 ultra 😊
TGWvTWtlvZo,"S24 ultra is like an 13 pro max when cames out. 

With changes in specs, good solidity, excellent battery, these are smarptjones that will hold up over time."
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Just bought a 512 GB one a week ago. Save for some overheating (which concerns me, not gonna lie), I've been loving it every millisecond of the way."
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Having had Android phones since the inception, the HTC G1, by far the s24 ultra is my favorite.
Flat screen, square screen edges, square body and everything else I've enjoyed. I use Nova launcher and have been for years. I like the menus and some tweaks of 1ui7 but I don't like the grid limit even when using good locks limits."
TGWvTWtlvZo,do you think that the price would go down by july. If so should I get it or the oneplus 13t/mini that is coming out in may/june.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Hey, you're a great tech YouTuber, but you're starting to miss a lot of details.  The S24 Ultra *does* have log video in One UI 7, it *does* have audio eraser, and the anti-reflective coating doesn't affect vibrancy—Samsung confirmed it.  Do more research before making videos, okay?"
TGWvTWtlvZo,I was literally on Backmarket to find a refurbished S24 Ultra lmao. I really want to upgrade from my S22 ultra to the S24 ultra mainly for the efficiency gains plus my current S22 ultra is dropping cellular data every now and then which sucks.
TGWvTWtlvZo,Bought one for me and one for my mom today for 700$ each. Can't wait to get it delivered!
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Tip the best deals for the current S-u are at Fold release,  i got my S24u 1tb for 1100$ , not changing phone for 3 to 4 years easy"
TGWvTWtlvZo,Upgrading from my Note 10plus soon to this. Love the premium look and boxy design
TGWvTWtlvZo,"As always another excellent video. You've become one of my go-to guys when I want to honest but easy to understand analysis of a particular phone or phones. I recently purchased the s25 ultra after having problems with the 15 pro Max which may not be much of an upgrade but I wanted a phone that would last me for at least the next 5 years if necessary and this gets the job done. I really considered the s24 ultra but was afraid of possibly inheritance someone else's glitch although that's even possible with a new phone. I have no regrets about getting the s25 ultra but yes, I would highly recommend s24 ultra if somebody wanted to save just a little bit of money and still pretty much get everything that I have. Once again excellent video, you have a friend in Columbus Ohio!"
TGWvTWtlvZo,Agrees Nick 👍🏻 I am a proud owner of this phone 😍😍
TGWvTWtlvZo,I've just bought a used S24 Ultra for £650 and it's immaculate with the box i was goin 2 get the S25 Ultra but decided 2 save some money with the condition of the S24 Ultra
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I had one and loved it, but then got a OnePlus 13  and the S24U then felt really slow and laggy. I could really tell the difference between a 2024 phone and a 2025 phone."
TGWvTWtlvZo,The Samsung Galaxy s24 ultra is amazing device its special had 100x zoom camera  ai  also pen control  fast charging  very powerful  device  i toldly recommend this spand a lot money
TGWvTWtlvZo,Yep. Still a great device. Glad I held onto it.
TGWvTWtlvZo,Watching from a base model s24 that I got on a good deal as a secondary phone. These s24's still feel powerful in 2025 but I'm still an apple sheep at the end of the day
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Good stuff Nick, please it may be out of your usual topics, but can you review the Nintendo switch 2?"
TGWvTWtlvZo,do you guys still have grainy screen (mura effect)? Mine is arriving soon I am so nervous not sure if they still have it in later batches
TGWvTWtlvZo,"""Still one of the best"" actually no. This is THE BEST phone ever made to date. Probably will be in a long long time."
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Hi, is there any change in battery life after update!"
TGWvTWtlvZo,All they need to do to be perfect is have a larger battery and a faster charging like Chinese oems. Maybe make the cameras a little bit better.
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I got the S24 Ultra for my birthday in October. For me, it's better than the S25 Ultra because it has the S-Pen with Bluetooth, and it only misses about three features from the S25, which aren't as useful or impactful + no overheating issues with it's processor like s25 has."
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Hi, I would like to ask if the noise remover from s25 ultra in editing videos also in s24 ultra?"
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Nice, I like this phone 😉"
TGWvTWtlvZo,Sure please do google pixel 8 pro in 2025 ❤🙏
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Hello Nick love your videos.
Can you recommend me a good smartphone as an upgrade from Infinix Note 10 Pro."
TGWvTWtlvZo,Im just starting to wonder if the extra bulk is worth it. My shoulder gets sore when im on my phone for too long and i rarely game  on it and usually have youtube playing with screen off. I also find it slightly difficult to type accurrately
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Yeah S24 U video ❤ thanx. I love mine and One UI 7 🎉 i save and keep this last mohican then when I update to a new one sometime. I want uppdate more when you closing cameras gallery if here find last video and close,its the only one where there are still animation problems sometimes, otherwise it's smoother all the time. Hope they nail it 100%."
TGWvTWtlvZo,Does it still have grainy display?
TGWvTWtlvZo,Got my s24u today and it's boxy shape looks so good 👍
TGWvTWtlvZo,"An Updated SoC, Downgraded Design, & a Downgraded S-Pen doesn't make you BETTER, let alone the BEST!

S24 Ultra STILL THE BEST PHONE EVERRR!!!"
TGWvTWtlvZo,meanwhile the S23 Ultra is 2000 RON or more in my country and S22 Ultra entered the reasonable price category (1000 RON)
TGWvTWtlvZo,"Watching from my S24 Ultra, same color, 512 GB. I just wish it had One UI 7"
TGWvTWtlvZo,Go camera and --> gallery last video and close it.. some time even yet its strugles.. but its smoother than ever i am very happy
TGWvTWtlvZo,S24 Ultra or S25+? Considering buying one of these two rn since they're within my budget range.
TGWvTWtlvZo,The s24 ultra is the last true ultra in the current line-up until I believe the S Pen will be coming back to the S26 Ultra.
TGWvTWtlvZo,I don't think I will update to the s25u or s26u if the 26 comes out similar to the 25. Also might consider going to other companies like one or google if they are better . My s24ultra was the first comeback to android after being iPhone only for the last 10+ years
TGWvTWtlvZo,Would it be worth it to buy the s24 ultra at the end of the year or beginning of next year? I’m trying to save money to buy the phone around then
TGWvTWtlvZo,I bought my 2 weeks ago 😊😊
TGWvTWtlvZo,will completely use up the up to 7 years software updates til it breaks.
TGWvTWtlvZo,Holding on to my S24 Ultra until the S27 Ultra comes..
TGWvTWtlvZo,"I have the Pixel 9XL, & iPhone 13 Pro Max, but if I were to get a Samsung, it would be the S24Ultra. Last great Samsung phone."
TGWvTWtlvZo,"In my opinion, the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the iPhone 16 Pro Max are some of the best overall options for a smartphone. I love my iPhone 15 Pro Max and can’t wait to upgrade to the 17 Pro Max."
TGWvTWtlvZo,Honestly the S24 Ultra or even the S23 Ultra are still my dream phone.. in the used market inside the US or EU they prolly cost less than half of their launch's price.. but not here in my country.. they still cost considerably high.. and i dont know what will happen even after the Trump's tariff..
TGWvTWtlvZo,I'm still undecided which one to get. This one or s25+ 😅
TGWvTWtlvZo,Off topic.  My s25U has taken a major hit on battery life since updating it. Ive had to charge it 2 times yesterday and it was only around 7:00PM its low af on battery now. Samsung needs to get their shit together this is messed up. The s24U is a damn nice phone though & worth the price if you're wanting an ultra.  I just don't like that coating on the s24U. It looks terrible after 6 months 😕 use a screen protector.
TGWvTWtlvZo,Hello Nick is there the galaxy a55 vs a56 comparison in plans?
TGWvTWtlvZo,"""Awesome content."" 🔥"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Link (with discount) to S25 ultra in my profile😀 SUBSCRIBE if you like tech content!
eiJ7ROJVj-4,The first noticeable difference is that they are the same
eiJ7ROJVj-4,The looks of the s24 looks way better than s25 ultra
eiJ7ROJVj-4,The physical look of S24 is truly amazing
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Samsung s24 ultra is way cheaper and better my opinion guyz!!😁
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Not worth upgrading in my opinion if you already have a s24 ultra
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"For everyone, the smoother and faster functions on the S25 series come to the S24 series as well. It's just One UI 7, not the new processor, because the processor from the S24 series is more than powerful enough to do these things; it's just software."
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Upgrading to the s25 ultra from s20 fe 😇
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Upgraded from an iphone 13 pro to the S25 Ultra and i can't believe what this phone is capable of
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I like the s24 ultra
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"Processing power has peaked before the 8 elite. The shutter speed that you are talking about is due to optimization of One Ui 7. Also the camera is the same, again slight differences due to ISP of the 8 elite and the rest due to One Ui 7.  

However, if you’re going to play some games and do emulations then you will certainly notice a difference."
eiJ7ROJVj-4,As always s24 looks more premium and its evergreen and unbeatable design
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Only legends will remember s21 and s22
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"Youtubers destroyed Samsung S25U. 1st removed curved display and then the boxy shape. Now it lost It's elegance,  looks more like Sony. Samsung should not listen to the youtubers. They should have that confidence on them like apple do. Apple do not listen to others, what they make, they make the people accept it."
eiJ7ROJVj-4,As a Note 20 Ultra its worth upgrading to the S24Ultra if you love the Bluetooth S Pen. Im not a fan of the Iphone looking round edges. The S Ultra replaced the Notes but with the new changes to the S pen and rounded edges they are slowly 🐌 losing what ppl love about the Note series 😢😤😳🙄😏 i think the plus and ultras should retain the sharp edges and the base mode can have the feminine round iphone curvy edge look.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I owned both and honestly... I miss my 24 Ultra. I think that's the best smartphone Samsung has ever made. The S25 Ultra is almost like a gimmick to Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max... the 24 was just better 😢
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"I'm a fan of the design they went with for the S25 but I *hate"" that they made it so lightweight. 221g is the sweet spot for XL flagships, not uncomfortable to hold but compact and with enough weight that it signals to your brain the build quality is great. I got to hold the S25 ultra at the store today and just, eugh, this will unfortunately be a deal breaker for me. It's not just light it's drastically lighter than any larger smartphone, giving it an unappealing hollowness to it. Maybe some people will like it, but 218 grams for a 6.9 in phone is insane. That's lighter than the iPhone 16 Plus which is already considered to be very light! This whole cheap feeling in the hand just makes me think about are all the hardware they've removed this year with the S-Pen. It really sucks because I love the design and one UI 7 is finally looking like a mature operating system."
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"That Snapdragon Elite is tempting AF, but I'm saving up for S24 Ultra.




Prices of Samsung Ultra phones here in my country can go upto 2500$ knowing that S25 Ultra is out, S24 ultra is going to be just 975$ which is still expensive, but not 2500$ expensive"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,love your vids bro. your editing is amazing & you teach us alot ❤
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Glad I saw this before rushing out to upgrade...
eiJ7ROJVj-4,upgrading to this from the s22. only reason i got the ultra was because it costed the same as a s25 plus on the samsung store
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"I love samsung ❤ ,  I have been using all s - Seris phone more than 10 years , but I am facing the back panel problem on all phone , After 1years .. I want to say samsung , Make a strong back panel.."
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"I got it about 2 days ago and I love this phone. Definitely an Upgrade from my S23 Ultra. The Battery life is insane. I lost 71% with a sceen on time of 10,5h"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Is it a good option to switch from iphone 13 to S24 ultra ???
eiJ7ROJVj-4,This makes me like the s25 ultra more.❤
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"Pre-ordered mine from S22 Ultra😅I know people say it aint worth the upgrade, but it is for me"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I wish the chip in s25 is in the s24
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I had a s7 for years. Finally had to upgrade to a s24 ultra with  a 1 gig. Gonna keep this phone for at least 5 years (cause thats.how great it is). Unlike the iPhone suckers buying every  new phone they come out every quarter.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Still on an s22 ultra and have zero need to upgrade.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"I'm still using my Galaxy A71 that i got 50% off 4 or 5 years ago. It soes luterally everything I need it to. 

I feel like unless money just isnt an issue, there really are diminishing returns on flagship cell phones!"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"Same same, but different(little bit)😁😁😁"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"With their obsession to copy Apple (not for the good stuff though) they ended up with generic looking device, less premium then S23/24U, similar to A series. Holding it is actually NOT comfortable since edges where glass and metal meet are not rounded but sharp."
eiJ7ROJVj-4,To me s25 ultra looking s24 ultra and 24ultra looking latest s25 ultra lol . S24 ultra is beast 🔥
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I have the S23U and I still think it's better than the S25U. Taking away the bluetooth functionality on the s-pen is a downgrade.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"What was the conclusion, should I Upgrade to S25 Ultra or Go for S24 Ultra 
Which one worth for the money"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I got all the AI gimmicks disabled on the S24 ultra.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Rounded edge on the s25 looks amazing and easier to hold and i love how they added the 50mp ultra wide but a little sad thing is that they removed the s pen bluetooth😔 but i still love the s25 ultra because of its snapdragon 8 elite and faster software .Thank you so much for making this video really appreciated it i subscribed
eiJ7ROJVj-4,s24u with OneUI7 is a beast 😝❤️
eiJ7ROJVj-4,is it just me or the rounded edge  for s25 ultra made it look cheaper than s24? Maybe bcuz Im used to seeing that rounded feature in the cheaper samsung phone models
eiJ7ROJVj-4,bought my s24 ultra just a while back for almost 50% less (including freebies) saw the 2 difference and i knew s24 is better.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"As a base S24 owner, is it even worth upgrading to the next generation?"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,The s24 looks better in the design than the 25 imo
eiJ7ROJVj-4,This is the gen meant for s21 and s22 users to upgrade it’s not worth it it if you have a 23 or 24
eiJ7ROJVj-4,They cut corners on the phone and the s pen 😭
eiJ7ROJVj-4,S24 Ultra is look so fabulous
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I upgraded from my s22 ultra from 2022 I upgrade every 3 years.  Loving my s25 ultra
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Please review and try Chinese phone brands such as Vivo and one plus and xoami and honor I bet you will love it or consider it😊
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Great video! You are definitely one of the best YouTubers on this platform.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Is the 6.9 inch display really noticeable?
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I wish the s22-24 ultras had the round edges man not really a fan of the sharp corners
eiJ7ROJVj-4,S24 ultra best design
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"The hardware changes are minimal, software from the s25 is gonna be in the s24. And no bluetooth s pen for s25 ultra unless you pay $50 on amazon for a bluetooth s pen"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Make a video about its durability and drop test
eiJ7ROJVj-4,S23 ultra the best🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"Thats so detailed, fast and explained everthing as possible, NOICE review."
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Thanks for the comparison broo.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I JUST got my new S24 Ultra in december 2024 should i upgrade (trade in) to the 25 ultra or wait for s26U? For anyone that had the 24U And upgraded was it worth it?  That extra inch in display is calling me although i wish it was alittle bigger in display lol
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I have s25ultra the only thing i crave is that bluetooth spen.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"I'm still on an S20 Ultra. I think it's fair to upgrade every 5 years or so. I loved my S20U, so hopefully I also love the S25U. :)"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"It is same-same,but different xD"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Yes that's large 6.8 or 6.9 yes that's large
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I love s 24 and s23 very beautiful
eiJ7ROJVj-4,24 still rules😢
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I want the s24 ultra.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"I have both the S24 ultra, NS25 ultra and truly. I like both of them in their own unique way in a way. I like to S24 better because of having my S Pen, but in a way, I like that's 24 survive ultra better because of having the faster processor in the AI that is better. But in all reality, I feel like that's twenty five, there's a bit of a downgrade, but I still love it"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"So when Apple does it, it’s outrageous to many people, and yet when Samsung does it, it’s absolutely fine"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,The s24 ultra looks better and the curved sides feel more comfortable to hold. Id probably go with that one
eiJ7ROJVj-4,The camera ring on S24 Ultra looks more premium than S25 ultra
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Missing s pen 😢
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Thanks I'm gonna return my S25 ultra
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Watching in s24 ultra.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Came from s22 ultra. I dont like the boxy design. I always want the s21 ultra display so at least its almost similar to my s25ultra.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I just got my S 24 ultra two weeks ago. I love the look of it versus the 25 and it’s amazing but I’m typing this on my iPhone.😂
eiJ7ROJVj-4,S24 is more premium than the S25
eiJ7ROJVj-4,s24 ultra scratches at level 7 with deeper grooves at level 8
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I am with s22 u and i have to choose now between s24 or s25?
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"For taking videos, would the camera of the S25+ be better than S24 U?"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I take the S24U over S25U anyday.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,ThE fIRst ✨️nOtAbLe✨️ diffeRenCe 6.9 -> 6.8
eiJ7ROJVj-4,everything is fine in the 25 ultra except those redesigned camera rings.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Both models are available on sale.. Buy whichever you like and stop comparing
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"My opinion for those undecided >>> if u hv a S24 Ultra now, dont upgrade cos S25 Ultra is only slightly better, esp from d processor, not worth d money after having S24 Ultra for a year or less. BUT if u DON'T hv a S24 Ultra now, by all means do UPGRADE to d S25 Ultra as its a superb hp!"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,What happened 🤔💭if we s24 ultra spen change in s25 ultra it will possibly to work.??
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Is shocking none of the reviews tell how much crisper the new screen is.  It's a noticeable difference.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,iPhone is the king I have been using galaxy ecosystem for a decade or more. I just switched to apple products. Galaxy is kids toys
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Stop hating the s24 ultra was a great phone so they didn’t change much and nobody needs to switch every year they don’t make the phone that way
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"Nem um, nem outro 😊"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,sometimes neither does samsung make large changes
eiJ7ROJVj-4,S24 ultra look best 🗿♥️🥰
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Just upgrade my s22+ to s25 ultra. A huge upgrade for me.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,The Applefication of Samsung.
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Make A Video About iPhone 8 Plus And Galaxy S9 Tab
eiJ7ROJVj-4,S25 ultra
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Apple increased display size samsung copied straightaway apple uses titanium samsung copied
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"Nothing,  but the gray problem and the banding problems come to with this""upgrate"""
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"It's 6.9"" because of the smaller bezels."
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Smother and faster because of one ui 7. Processor doesn't make any difference in such case
eiJ7ROJVj-4,"If u have s24u, dont upgrade to s25u. If u have anything else, upgrading to s25u is not a bad idea"
eiJ7ROJVj-4,Compare tha s25 ultra with the iphone 16 pro max please
eiJ7ROJVj-4,I have s23 ultra and not gonna upgrade to s25 ultra. All the AI upgrades are gonna come to my phone nonetheless
shlTpFa3F78,Samsung had Always on display before iPhones but I was referring to having a dimmed version of your wallpaper on the always on display.
shlTpFa3F78,Uhm? Always On Display has been on Samsung for ages and it's not a thing that Apple was first with so there's that!
shlTpFa3F78,Switched from iPhone to 24 ultra and I’m never going back lol
shlTpFa3F78,The sharp corners means you have something for self defence. You can dual wield too. Sharp cornered S24U in one hand and pointed S pen in the other.
shlTpFa3F78,"I never notice the ""sharp corners"" because I always have a case on. Are people going case free with these expensive phones?"
shlTpFa3F78,her definition of small makes me happy
shlTpFa3F78,"S20 and note 20 ultra had a 5x camera, always on display for years"
shlTpFa3F78,Switched from 14 pro max to s24. Things been going so great
shlTpFa3F78,Galaxy S7 & S7 edge with Always-On Display: Are you kidding me? 😂
shlTpFa3F78,Apple never had always on display first.
shlTpFa3F78,"Guys she meant the iPhone style always on display because Samsungs only had the clock and some other things before but now it also has the whole screen aod feature, do some research before typing!!"
shlTpFa3F78,S24 looks so much more modern.
shlTpFa3F78,"I've been driving my S24 Ultra daily, and I haven't had a single issue with the corner, with or without a case."
shlTpFa3F78,Did you just say apple did always on display first?
shlTpFa3F78,"""But it's small"" bro really loves em big"
shlTpFa3F78,I am sure that S-pen has a great personality.
shlTpFa3F78,S24 ultra is the best ❤
shlTpFa3F78,"if you have an apple watch, macbook, ipad etc. buy an iphone, if not, by a samsung. simple"
shlTpFa3F78,"They are different phones, both are good phones, doesn't matter who's better, you can't go wrong with either."
shlTpFa3F78,you forgot something… S24 ultra has 100x zoom camera.
shlTpFa3F78,imessage and airdrop are the reason why I’m sticking to my iphone.. it’s simple and not gimmicky.. but I’d always want an ultra
shlTpFa3F78,"I think the sharp corners are way better since it gives you the laptop or tv feeling, the rounded corners didn't look as good once the s22 ultra came out"
shlTpFa3F78,“It’s small though” every guys worst nightmare
shlTpFa3F78,"Hey! That pen has feelings, also its average"
shlTpFa3F78,“But it's small though” that's what she said 😩
shlTpFa3F78,Media button always on display and 5x zoom was on samsung first and the ultra have also 100x zoom
shlTpFa3F78,Like always Ella greeting us with a smile in her videos
shlTpFa3F78,Guys s!! I had a huawei that could also split screens! I loved that so much!
shlTpFa3F78,Oh wait NOT ANYMORE 😅❤🎉
shlTpFa3F78,"She spoke “AOD” but if you read it, it says Dim wallpaper AOD. Shorts are also for watching, not just listening to. I’m an iSheep and a Sammy fan. I prefer the dim wallpaper AOD to the old, boring clock and calendar or tiny picture."
shlTpFa3F78,You are the best 💖
shlTpFa3F78,sure sure but what she didnt mention is the fact that you can change the sound of your spen when you insert it and take it out 😐
shlTpFa3F78,"Both are great phones, and you can't tell me otherwise. They each have their pros and cons, to the extent that they're basically equal to each other. Each generation, one phone edges ahead of the other, the S23 comes out and it's better than the iPhone 14, then the iPhone 15 comes out and surpasses the S23, followed by the S24 which outperforms the iPhone 15, and so on, so they are right on each other's tails, and yes sometimes the cycle stops for a bit but a few more phones later, the cycle continues. Also, there's no good reason to label either one as trash. Like why do you gotta do that, like what? Because you want everyone to switch to the one you're comfortable with? You need to understand that people have their own comfort zones. Why are we in a time where people always have to make others feel bad because their phone isn't considered good enough by THEIR preferred brand? I’m honestly just tired of people trashing on Apple or Samsung."
shlTpFa3F78,They are both equally good it matters what you like and perfer like some people like iPhone other people like android phones it only matter what you are happy with also electronic wars in general just suck it matter what you like
shlTpFa3F78,"I have both (work and personal). I like the camera and the S Penin S24U, love editing with the S Len, it is so precise and just the way I like it. But for daily usage I prefer the iP15PM because everything in it works just a little more smoothly and updates are timely. But the S24U was still on June 2023 Google Play Store  software till an hour ago (just got the JAN 2024 update half hour ago). But the discounts and free gifts on S24U make it a worthwhile purchase."
shlTpFa3F78,S24 Ultra is a heavy bulky bathroom tile and it's fantastic.
shlTpFa3F78,"Overall performance and features: S24 Ultra
Hype and fashion: iPhone 15 Pro Max"
shlTpFa3F78,Samsung: Come on.... talk about camera....
shlTpFa3F78,Nowadays Iphone is just a brand and nothing more
shlTpFa3F78,"What i really like from iphone is, the siri. I can easily access to call my contact & reply mssges whenever i'm driving. Android also have gemini/google and its so hard to call the google out, quite slow as well. Not as easy and fast as siri."
shlTpFa3F78,"IPhone: we are always better
Samsung: umm, we me your screens, batteries, cameras, memorys and other components"
shlTpFa3F78,No one worries.   It still calls. Most people have both brands if not another for the family.    Thx anyway ✌️🌎
shlTpFa3F78,Apple? Trendsetter?? Come on.. I honestly expected better lol.
shlTpFa3F78,"First things first iPhone 15 came out on 2023 under 24 came ultra came out on 2024 if if it was the 15 pro Max and the estimate, then the 15th would’ve been, but if it was the iPhone 11 Pro Max I thought that releases versus 24 ultra, then that would probably win, unless I don’t know"
shlTpFa3F78,"Android had AOD for decades , what are you on ?"
shlTpFa3F78,Switched from 14 to s24 ultra..and i just loved it❤
shlTpFa3F78,"S24 ultra is better, I mean just because you personally dp t like the design doesn't mean the phone is bad"
shlTpFa3F78,Phone wars in 2024 is stupid. Like people have preferences and there could be a thousand reason why they would chose one phone over another
shlTpFa3F78,What do you mean 5x on the 24 ultra. It has 100x zoom
shlTpFa3F78,"I love the sharp edges, don't make it an issue!!!"
shlTpFa3F78,iPhone lovers -----------------•••❤
shlTpFa3F78,BEsides the two phones I think youre the best ❤
shlTpFa3F78,"anyway, after more than 15 years of dealing with Apple devices and a billion issues happens to me starting from battery life then iso responding when a new phone comes out and blalblla... the current issue in my current iphone has ... IM LITERALLY A FAN but I'm planning to move on .. I'm gonna give all my feelings
 to the next brand that gonna last with me longer with minimum simple issues."
shlTpFa3F78,"Trend setter? Samsung has HAD Always On Displays, Stickers, FULL customization of the UI and 10x zoom + 100x space zoom.

How in the world is the iPhone a trendsetter when it literally copied Android at this point?"
shlTpFa3F78,"Samsung also has the dynamic Island, has had it for a while it's just totally digital not physical like the iPhones"
shlTpFa3F78,"“But it’s small tho”
😭"
shlTpFa3F78,i used 14 pro max which i brought 7 months ago and i am very happy i exchanged with s24 ultra the features what android have is way better than i phone and about the performance although its a little low than the 15 pro max but at least it doesnt cook my hand like ios
shlTpFa3F78,When she said trend setter it was so majestic ✨
shlTpFa3F78,They both the best. I like social apps on iphone. Love iphone video also but samsung photo process better camera. The screen also full gaming screen. Dynamic island really annoying in some game like pubg n ML. Watching netflix n youtube on s24 also 👌. Im using both phones. My personal sim on iphone. Work sim on s24 ultra
shlTpFa3F78,"These phones may be big, but not bigger than the space for you in my heart"
shlTpFa3F78,"It doesn’t matter which phone is better, it’s better to get the phone that best serves your ecosystem. I have the ip15 and so far so good"
shlTpFa3F78,"Team both
👇"
shlTpFa3F78,On my shorts you appeared right next to a Jennie from BlackPink Short and I never realized how similar you guys looked until I was looking at both of you at the same time.
shlTpFa3F78,Wait. Rez means resolution which comes from the screen resolution and when a phone has titanium means that's built with that material. Am I guessing right?
shlTpFa3F78,"Great content.  Also the s24 ultra,  has Dex, you can have no widgets on your home screen and also have live home screen wallpaper. My home screen has rain coming down it."
shlTpFa3F78,"""But its small tho"" Well thats bigger than mine"
shlTpFa3F78,"Fun fact, before LG stopped making their phones, they were basically the first ones to come up with ""always on"" display. I forget which phone it was, but it had an extra display on the top that was always on and showed the time and messages and a few other notifications. 

As a matter of fact, LG basically pioneered most of the features that androids and apple have. You just have looknback at their phones. 

Their downfall was always trying to come up with new concepts every year and never really had a flag ship to compete with others. LG did make some great phones in my opinion tho, especially the screens and cameras"
shlTpFa3F78,Samsung Galaxy S series will always be the king.   Both Galaxy S and iPhones take terrific pictures.  It has cone to the point on pictures and videos that it's now exceptional on the way they look.
shlTpFa3F78,"One handed plus kills the action button by mere directional swipes . I have 6 actions set , one set as a screen shot and it's too nifty."
shlTpFa3F78,“A Samsung a day keep apple away” 💀💀💀
shlTpFa3F78,"I hadn’t really thought of that, but yeah, the Ultra does have nasty sharp corners, true that."
shlTpFa3F78,"Both are great phones. The processor performance on both is the same. If you say the Snapdragon 3rd gen is better for gaming, the A17 Pro Bionics can also handle any demanding game smoothly. The same applies to intensive video editing and rendering tasks. You need to check multiple sources to gain insight into that. 

In daily use, you won't even notice the difference. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. The sole disparity lies in our biased mindset."
shlTpFa3F78,"Better security, apple ecosystem, better gaming, which u don’t need,that’s it basically 💀"
shlTpFa3F78,i like the automations in iphone but i also like the split-screen in android phones..so i bought the iphone and got me a cheap android phone..my problem solved..😁😁✌🏿
shlTpFa3F78,Because 3-5 business YEARS EARLIER Samsung had it...
shlTpFa3F78,"""But it's small though"" 💀"
shlTpFa3F78,"“So what happened at school today?”
“I got stabbed by a Samsung”"
shlTpFa3F78,"1924: In 2024 we will have flying cars!
2024: War between phones 💀"
shlTpFa3F78,as having both I prefer the s24 ultra beside of does brands Samsung hade on display first before iphone but the phone with on display first was a Nokia 6303 back in 2008
shlTpFa3F78,i feel like samsung would be the actual BEST phone ever if it had facetime and less sharp corners because i think the samsung is really cool with long battery and a big zoom (coming from a iphone user)
shlTpFa3F78,"THE sharp cormers ON    the  S24 ultra   in  your  hand  Ella
why   you  owed"
shlTpFa3F78,Erm as a dress to impress player when i heard ‘tRenD seTteR’…
shlTpFa3F78,I saw a video on the first iphone and they pretty much said no to pens as touch screens were the future… and what use would a pen have if your gonna do art use a tablet
shlTpFa3F78,There's a feature on any samsung phone where you can turn your on button to a Double press to do actions
shlTpFa3F78,"As an iphone user, samsung is better, people are buying iphone just for the look, but in reality, samsung has the best android system ever"
shlTpFa3F78,"My boyfriend got a 15 Pro Max from his company, and we love Samsung, and so far, it really feels premium and everything like that. But we really dont like the cameras, and I thought Samsung produced saturated images and videos, but Apple does it as well, but it's way more saturated."
shlTpFa3F78,"As a person who used s6 edge before when it was relased, Samsung Galaxy S series is good. A series is usually meh."
shlTpFa3F78,I like iphone ecosystem and samsung both phones are great but for my daily use or daily driver i prefer to use samsung
shlTpFa3F78,Galacticus 3.0 FTW baby😎
shlTpFa3F78,S24 Ultra  Eng zo‘ri 👍🏻💪🏻.  Iphone musrku uni yonida 👎🏻👎🏻.
shlTpFa3F78,"If this were an ad, thanks for selling me the Ultra. It is not an ad and yet I'll still take the Ultra. That phone is epic!"
shlTpFa3F78,SAMSUNG also have an option to change home and power key settings i used in my  2017 Galaxy too
shlTpFa3F78,"So, more biased comments? Just give it a rest. Both phones are good and have their ups and downs. The hate for both models is unjustified."
shlTpFa3F78,I like the look of the corners
shlTpFa3F78,"Which one is better? I prefer… 
No a phone is not objectively better, it’s better for the user, because (shocking) a phone that’s is better made to suit your needs is better for you, use as many as you can and then decide"
shlTpFa3F78,Both on top ❤🎉
shlTpFa3F78,I hope i can buy one of that phone someday😢
shlTpFa3F78,I feel like both wre the best not need to fight about which one is the best in my opinion
shlTpFa3F78,The 24 ultra has a 200 megapixel camera! While the a Iphone has only 48 mp! Samsung wins
shlTpFa3F78,"At this price level, the question isnt about which one anymore. Its about why do you need this?"
ITJVzQXIUco,i am s24 ultra user . its my first flagship phone .. really amazing phone
ITJVzQXIUco,Loving my S24 Ultra 😍😍
ITJVzQXIUco,"S24U outshines S25U for its iconic angular screen & curve sides, bluetooth spen and 1st phone in jerry rig test scratches at lv 7 with deeper grooves at lv 8"
ITJVzQXIUco,My s24 ultra feels new even today. Was waiting for this review. Thanks Nick
ITJVzQXIUco,"Time is going very fast.
Still feels like yesterday it came out."
ITJVzQXIUco,I’ll even dare say it’s the best Samsung phone I’ve owned ever. My first Samsung phone was the G800 and the tech has come along way since then.
ITJVzQXIUco,Watching on S24 Ultra ❤🎉
ITJVzQXIUco,"I've had the blue 1gb since launch, and i absolutely LOVE this phone! I use the s pen at least once a week (notes at church), and i love having so much storage that i don't have to worry about deleting apps in order to free up space (only have 25% full!). It acts, looks, and feels premium, and i can't see myself getting rid of it anytime soon."
ITJVzQXIUco,I am getting the S24 ultra for my 21st birthday in March
ITJVzQXIUco,Im absolutely loving this phone. It's been a joy to use and I'll be keeping it for atleast 3/4 years
ITJVzQXIUco,Both the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra are damn good phones. Love my S25U.
ITJVzQXIUco,"ive been running s24 ultra for just about a year now its never had a screen protector i work in construction with dirt sand concrete dust floating around my pocket with my phone a year later its still scratch free love the anti-glare the screen offers if i put a screen protector on it, it with cover that feature........ my opinion one of the best features"
ITJVzQXIUco,I think Samsung actually listens to customers unlike Apple.
ITJVzQXIUco,When recommendation is faster than notification 😅
ITJVzQXIUco,Perfectly satisfied with my S24 Ultra
ITJVzQXIUco,The 8 gen 3 for galaxy in the s24 ultra can handle almost anything you throw at it so I'll be sticking to it until the S26 ultra
ITJVzQXIUco,Big thanks Nick giving love to the S24 ultra! I have the same color & a beast of a phone it is. Enjoyed this video 👏🏻
ITJVzQXIUco,"I do love my S24U as well..got it in May 2024, but I still use my Xperia XA2 Ultra from 2018th for nearly everything (without a sim) 😅 
S24U was the closest to XA2 from the outside."
ITJVzQXIUco,"If Samsung offers a great trade-in deal, then I'll upgrade my S24 Ultra. Otherwise, it's a keeper!"
ITJVzQXIUco,Samsung created a new revolution
ITJVzQXIUco,I just got an S24 ultra 2 weeks ago after having cheaper Motorola  phones for 9 years. Talk about a great phone! I'm really amazed at what I've been missing.
ITJVzQXIUco,"I return to Samsung after I owned an S22+, so I got The 24 Ultra in March 2024 and to my suprise I enjoyed this phone so much, the design, the software, I dare to say that One UI is getting so much better. I'll watch the unpack to see if the S25 is worth the upgrade, if not I'll remain happily with my S24 Ultra. Once again great video Nick!"
ITJVzQXIUco,Im S24 Ultra user & im lovin it. Got it last year April 2024 & will never bother about latest model release..❤❤❤
ITJVzQXIUco,"S24 ultra🥰 The best phone ever🤩 flat screen....Note style....Great camera....Decent battery

Moreover, This amazing device will  have a good long years of software updates"
ITJVzQXIUco,"Best phone I've ever had, it can do anything I need."
ITJVzQXIUco,I got my s24u  October last year and I absolutely loving it!
ITJVzQXIUco,First andriod phone I used and I won't be going back to apple. 😂😂
ITJVzQXIUco,"I have my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra since almost 1 Year now! I like it very much! Battery health is at 97 %, no scratches"
ITJVzQXIUco,Samsung S24 Ultra is already so good and tommorow the Samsung s25 Ultra is releasing🔥
ITJVzQXIUco,"Bro , Its just a beast . Rocking so hard"
ITJVzQXIUco,Getting the s24u this week! So excited
ITJVzQXIUco,"I use it alongside the Note9, and the cameras are for me the only improvements over that one. In other words, when I don't need the cameras, it hardly matters which device I reach for, as both are great."
ITJVzQXIUco,Can't wait for the s25 ultra review 🎉
ITJVzQXIUco,Using it for last 1 month. Amazing device 🔥
ITJVzQXIUco,i had s24 ultra since first came out and this is the first time i ever gave a phone 10/10 score
ITJVzQXIUco,Loving my 2 weeks old s24 ultra❤
ITJVzQXIUco,just bought s24u ultra last week instead of s25u. i feel like with the price drop this phone is so much worth to buy than the newer version. glad i still get the new old stock
ITJVzQXIUco,"I have had my maxed out note 20 ultra for 3 years and never had any issues after multiple drops the camera wiggles, and now the best option is this beast maxed out....Thanks for the great review and revisit of the note 24 ultra"
ITJVzQXIUco,How did you keep the screen so clean? I keep hearing about the oleophobic coating issue
ITJVzQXIUco,"What's up Nick. Hope u had a happy holiday season, especially as a new dad. I have the Z Fold5 and I'm considering getting the S25 Ultra, but wanted to get ur thoughts on the S24 Ultra"
ITJVzQXIUco,"I also have very bad OCD when it comes to my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, Playstation 5 Slim and Playstation 5 Pro, my 43"" Samsung Crystal 4K UHD 60hz TU7000 TV, and many more of my prized possessions. I definitely feel you on those tiny scuffs being something that triggers your OCD because this is exactly how I feel when any of my prized possessions take any type of physical damage whatsoever, even if its so minor that you have to zoom in or look incredibly close to see it. It's cool to know im not alone with this kind of stuff. Those minor scuffs on the corners od your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra would most definitely trigger my OCD. This is why I make sure to use a Tech 21 Evo Clear Case and Zagg Invisible Shield XTR2 Eco Curve Screen Protector. I never take my phone out of the case or take off my screen protector unless it's time to replace it."
ITJVzQXIUco,Wow! You’re doing an amazing job.
ITJVzQXIUco,Thanks for the video. Just one question (hope it's not already answered). Are you using a protective glass? How's the wear on the screen glass?
ITJVzQXIUco,"I got mine on pre-order.   A year later, I am still loving it.  The phone was worth it."
ITJVzQXIUco,"I have an S24U too for like half a year, and i'm pretty satisfied. I was an iPhone user for some years before this Samsung and probably only things that i didn't like was some apps oprimization, especially facebook, is pretty annoing and have a lot of bugs. But over all is a solid phone, is not the best, but is a veeery good all rounder and the cameras are good, not gbe greatest in industry, but if you get used to it and know how to use it at full potential, you can take very good shots, especially with zoom lens😁"
ITJVzQXIUco,Love my S24 ultra ❤️
ITJVzQXIUco,S24u is the best phone ever
ITJVzQXIUco,How is the screen with the finger prints being difficult to remove. You see this as an issue after a year. Does it matter if you pre-order or wait until they fix all the bugs.
ITJVzQXIUco,"It’s an absolute killer phone, I do love mine and will be keeping it for quite a few years but I do have to disagree on the camera. It’s the only weak link in its armour. I don’t rate it at all. I much prefer my iPhone 16 pro max or even pixel 8a for taking pictures."
ITJVzQXIUco,"Thank you for a great video. We appreciate your honest opinion. I love the S pen, & the boxy look that sets it apart from IPhone. I'm a die-hard Note user. Too bad the S25 is just another IPhone clone look alike. I'm waiting to have my S 24 Ultra delivered soon. Thanks."
ITJVzQXIUco,"I remember back in the day, checking out the Note 4 the one with leather back and being blown away by the design and display. Used to own an S2 back then and was so tempted to upgrade but stayed away coz I couldn't afford it but the awe-struck feeling stuck."
ITJVzQXIUco,Was able to get it for $645 USD recently. Upgrading from a Samsung S21 FE 5G.
ITJVzQXIUco,Getting my new S24 tomorrow thanks to your review & for Mario bragging about how satisfied he is with his S24! 😊 Convinced it’s the best phone ever!!
ITJVzQXIUco,Just picked one up for 409 euro on contract. Didn't like the looks of the s25  ultra and wanted the shared off designs. Also you can control your TV with this if it's a samsung 😂😂
ITJVzQXIUco,"I used to be a lover of iPhone and Apple ecosystem, but tbh, I think Samsung is way better. It is fun to have. Switching to Samsung was really awesome."
ITJVzQXIUco,"I'm consider changing my 8 years old Xiaomi for this S24 Ultra and since i'm keeping my phones for long, do you think they will keep their promise to upgrade it for 7 years ?"
ITJVzQXIUco,One drop in owning it almost a year is all it took to take out the screen. Switched to the OnePlus 13 because I cannot afford $1500 for 512GB of storage and haven't looked back.
ITJVzQXIUco,I'm still here with my note 10+ 5G
ITJVzQXIUco,Nice video. Thanks
ITJVzQXIUco,"Hi Nick, are you gonna trade the s24U in for the s25U again? Or are you gonna keep it & do more versus videos, since people are keeping their phones longer now. Or are you only gonna keep iPhones?"
ITJVzQXIUco,"I really enjoyed s24 series esp, the 24 base model. It has an amazing camera system compared to predicessor n to some of her competitor on the go…good battery life n more."
ITJVzQXIUco,"Had the s21 ultra and absolutely loved it even tho it didn't have an s-pen. well, that one decided to die yesterday, and ordered this today, can''t wait to get it!"
ITJVzQXIUco,"Hi Nick, Great review, just one question does it compress videos when you upload on social media, eg. TikTok etc. compared to iphone. Does it reduce quality? Plz"
ITJVzQXIUco,"Heyy man! Should I wait for the s25 ultra or go with the s24 ultra? Kinda want a badass phone, cause I had the s22 ultra, but had to get a cheapy phone, cause the update messed up my ultra! I currently have the s24 fe but want something better!"
ITJVzQXIUco,And tomorrow the s25 ultra will be revealed. Time is going by so fast! s25 ultra will be phone of the year 2025.
ITJVzQXIUco,just got it today for 500!  someone upgraded to the 25 got a great deal on it so far i love it
ITJVzQXIUco,"If they'd change SW photo over-processing (video and front faced are great) and added battery >5000mah with faster charging - it would be my primary phone. Now I use Xiaomi 13 Pro more often since I take a lot of photos in nature and can't always drag my DSLR along. Shame because on 25 they removed BT from pen and I do use that as remote for camera when Samsung is on stand, so I'll skip 25 altogether.

Bottom line, amazing all rounder, one of the best for that, but if you're a niche user, especially for photography, there are better options out there."
ITJVzQXIUco,Was it worth the price?? usually it doesn't matter most of us..most of us just finance phones through our carrier and upgrade and jump to next phone. I don't have $1300 to drop all at once
ITJVzQXIUco,"Hi, I hope you noticed this. Can you create a video comparing an updated S24 Ultra vs. an out-of-the-box one? Since I tested my S24 Ultra and a demo unit from the physical store today, the difference in camera performance was noticeable."
ITJVzQXIUco,"I got S25 ultras with a trade of S24 Ultra and when I used both at the same time, I have decided to keep my S24 ultra and returning the S25 Ultra today. When you hold the S24 Ultra, you feel you are having a very powerful, strong, and stylish/different phone unlink the S25 Ultra it appears like any other phone."
ITJVzQXIUco,"Nice video! Just upgraded my s23u to s24u titanium grey and it loooooks sexy. Way more premium looking than the s25u. For me overall, not much diff with s23u but i love the fact that this has 7 yrs software support. :)"
ITJVzQXIUco,"For me it's only been 7days, I got mine on S25 Launch day for $750/used in new condition."
ITJVzQXIUco,Good video. Should I just wait for the s25 ultra or get the s24 ultra right now?
ITJVzQXIUco,I think I will pick this phone over the iPhone 16 pro max Mr Nick😊😊
ITJVzQXIUco,"S24U still awesome. I thought i wanted upgrade to smaller S24+ I did it , but some reason don't like 25+ so going back to my S24 Ultra"
ITJVzQXIUco,"S23 Ultra 2 years later? 
Im an S23 Ultra owner and I got to say the S24 Ultra will be remembered for being a peak note phone. S24 Ultra so cool. Still love my S23 Ultra but S24 Ultra flat display seems much easier to apply screen protectors."
ITJVzQXIUco,I have the 512 gb version of the s24 ultra titanium black
ITJVzQXIUco,"hello Nick, how do you order the samsung ? i mean do you order it from there website??"
ITJVzQXIUco,After the software update how is the  phone doing? Has it got any downgrades yet?
ITJVzQXIUco,Note series convert to fold. What do you think nick
ITJVzQXIUco,"Hi Nick,
Thank you for the great video.
can you help me out choosing between the oneplus 13 and the s24 ultra i even got a deal on the s24 ultra now just for  900 euros.
Please let me know what you think.
Thank you very much!"
ITJVzQXIUco,S24u and s25u are 100% worth the money. S25u will last even longer being on an entirely new infrastructure in specs.
ITJVzQXIUco,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is one of my favorite smartphones of all time. However, I actually prefer the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra more for their better design, curved display, more premium looking Armor Aluminum build, and 10mp 10x optical telephoto cameras. Since all of the recent Samsung Galaxy S Ultra Series smartphones have basically the same specs, features, capabilities, and software, it mostly comes down to which design looks better to me. My top 5 favorite smartphones of all time in order based on their design and specs are the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and Samsung Galaxy Note 10+."
ITJVzQXIUco,"YouTubers will gloat over the Samsung phones, but never use them as their main phones lol"
ITJVzQXIUco,"I got this phone to start vlogging, the camera is amazing, also why don't you have case?"
ITJVzQXIUco,"guys, i'm thinking of getting the s24 ultra, but i've been seeing some reviews saying it still gets laggy and stutters even after updates?? any s24 ultra users here — please give me your honest opinionnnn!
(p.s. i used to have the iphone x and wasn't happy with the heating + battery life, which is why i'm considering switching to samsung)"
ITJVzQXIUco,I'm changing from S22U to S25U
ITJVzQXIUco,Should I get the s24 ultra or get the s25 base model?
ITJVzQXIUco,Watching on my S24 Ultra.
ITJVzQXIUco,I hopefully will order one from ebay tomorrow Im excited
ITJVzQXIUco,Tomorrow the galaxy s25 ultra will come out
ITJVzQXIUco,"Been with Apple for years but last year got mine Feb 4,2024 and damaged my Screen 01/17/2025. My ointment (glass container) accidently dropped on my screen now it has a permanent white edge light on the top line and a cracked near the Front Facing Camera. Busy to go in a Samsung Service Center but not Sure if Samsung can replace my Screen and retain the water resistance.. I heard once opened the water resistance is Gone. 

Does someone know the Answer? Still loving my S24 Ultra."
ITJVzQXIUco,"agree with you and I think I'll keep this even if I get something new, desing i love it 😊"
ITJVzQXIUco,"After using for 9 months my s24 ultra performance is 2069 on single core and 6325 on multicore on geekbench, but it is lower that average can anyone tell the reason?"
ITJVzQXIUco,"I keep looking at the S25 Ultra and even the Plus, but I am not sure I want to upgrade. I still owe $794.45, and I still have 22 more months. Boost Mobile states I can upgrade every year, but I will be put back on a 36-month contract."
ITJVzQXIUco,S24 Ultra 🥰🔥
ITJVzQXIUco,Buying a 2nd hand 1tb S24U today! Excited for it! 🥳
ITJVzQXIUco,I love my S24 Ultra!
ITJVzQXIUco,"Hey Nick. I’m a 13 mini user switching to S25. I’m not a fan of big phones. However, I’m a fan of the benefits of a big phone. Do u think I would get used to an S25+ or ultra? Maybe with a MagSafe pop socket? I only ask because I know you have experience going from a mini to a large phone. Thanks if you have time."
ITJVzQXIUco,"Love the video, but do you not remember the charging fires?
NOT ridiculous about the scuffs. I'm like that too."

qi60AwPzyBY,"I have both...when it comes to the clarity of a zoomed image, the iPhone still can't hold a candle to the Samsung S24 Ultra..."
qi60AwPzyBY,Samsung has the best Ai scaling out of all phones … wish Apple would follow
qi60AwPzyBY,I'm on a 4 year old S20 fe. Samsung is not gonna support any new updates for my phone. So I think I will get the S24 Ultra.
qi60AwPzyBY,"Eu gosto muito da Apple, mas a câmera do Samsung é maravilhosa, mas cada um tem um gosto e vamos ver até onde a evolução vai levar esses dois aparelhos"
qi60AwPzyBY,"Both phones only have a 5x lens as max, the rest is just artificial digital zooming and cropping of the 5x lens image. If you take the picture you can further zoom in on iPhone image to have the same detail and resolution as the Samsung “100x” zoom. With that said, Apple should just allow users to go to 100x with a button or slider within the camera app like Samsung. They likely don’t do it because you don’t get good quality images that way, whereas 25x you can still get decent quality images and resolution."
qi60AwPzyBY,I have always upgraded to the new flagship.  Now I'm trying to manage a longer S24 U and I'm waiting for One ui 7 because it changes the whole experience.. nowadays the update times are so small that it's a complete waste of money to change every year.
qi60AwPzyBY,Me patiently waiting for it to be compared to the Legendary LG V60❤❤
qi60AwPzyBY,S24 ultra better than 16 pro max and samsung's cpu is worlds biggest phone cpu snapdragon 8gen
qi60AwPzyBY,"I dont see the purpose of zoom test

Do a proper camera test zoom is just fun thing but not a deal breaker"
qi60AwPzyBY,Samsung can do full screen camera view. you just got to turn it on in settings just like Apple
qi60AwPzyBY,"Wah! S24 Ultra ka zoom dekh ke maza aa gaya 🔥
Maine bhi ek zoom test kiya hai – kaafi crazy result mila 😲"
qi60AwPzyBY,Turn on Raw Max and see the quality it'll deck that S24
qi60AwPzyBY,Samsung🗿🔥
qi60AwPzyBY,Porque raio a Apple não atualizou o zoom da câmera no 16.. que raiva.. quero fazer um upgrade.. gosto de usar iOS mas o S24 tem umas coisinhas interessantes incluindo o raio do Zoom que dá para ver os ETs a jogar as cartas na lua wtf
qi60AwPzyBY,Now if apple user said our 25x zoom is like 100x of samsung now we know your cap
qi60AwPzyBY,"Yeah i mean samsung has 5x optical zoom, apple has same, but samsung is still better"
qi60AwPzyBY,Boy that android camera shakey af ain't no way in hell🤣🤣🤣
qi60AwPzyBY,"TEAM SAMSUNG 
              👇"
qi60AwPzyBY,"J'aime iPhone depuis le 14 Pro Max mais le zoom Samsung S-24 Ultra est une merveille et ce depuis le, S-21 Ultra, tout particulièrement en zoom x10 et 30.
Le S-25 Utra aura un matos photo amélioré.
Je préfère Android car des tas de possibilités après root."
qi60AwPzyBY,Un par de años más estará igual que el actual Samsung y el Samsung será mejor siempre
qi60AwPzyBY,Camera King samsung Always ❤❤❤
qi60AwPzyBY,Very nice zoom that we don’t need to use it. Good job Samsung carry on zooming well.
qi60AwPzyBY,Samsung ❤
qi60AwPzyBY,"If your purpose to buying these two great phones for zooming it's better for you not to buy, it's better to look for a big telescope 🔭 with 100,000,000 Giga Pixel."
qi60AwPzyBY,Always father samsung 😮😮
qi60AwPzyBY,"Who ever laughing and dominiting iphone, let me tell you all one thing in real time we dont use zoom features remember this instead we are more focused of selfies and less focused on using the rear camera which we usually use for the normal family, friends snap.

So, we are not a professional photographers who use zoom features to click far side objects

qi60AwPzyBY,well I mean why the hell would anyone need to zoom in 100x atp js use a microscope or walk over there? 😭

You don't have to be so scared of the Samsung brand. Seriously you're showing the iPhone phone even more crush! In this video, the mindless friend tries to disrupt the image of Samsung brand, but the real damage brand is IPhone. A real comparison is also original Samsung will always win in everything. This Super Intelligence (!) Because the person knows this truth and truth, he's making a replica Samsung comparison with the original iPhone! It's Really A shame! Samsung is always better 😅"

NMD3DrxMcN8,The thing is i would never use this feature and i never did 😂
NMD3DrxMcN8,I thought it was bull but my s24 ultra doesnt adjust to a phone light either but it does with a light bulb

H93pl8i-pJk,When you remove the watermark once u hit done it will add a new one. Can't remove the watermark like that.
H93pl8i-pJk,I use routines to turn off fast charging at night when I'm sleeping. I also turn on battery saving mode if not charging at night which helps if I forget to plug it in.
H93pl8i-pJk,"Out of a majority of visuals I've seen on the new Galaxy s24s', I havent seen one this informative. Definitely a new subscriber! Thanks so much!"

H93pl8i-pJk,"GREAT TIPS. BUT, PLEASE SPEAK A BIT SLOWER NEXT TIME."
H93pl8i-pJk,"For me, a Samsung is a Samsung thanks to GoodLock. I can't imagine not having it. Love big displays coming from the Note series, and there's an option to put a gesture arrow that can be used in different directions and for different amounts of times to perform customized actions like blocking the phone, bring notification bad down, go to last app, etc. Game changer!"
H93pl8i-pJk,Im switching from 11pro max to s24 ultra im excited!! Its long overdue but ive always wanted to switch its now time!!

H93pl8i-pJk,"Hi. Thanks, great vidoe! Only one thing I do not see on my S24 Ultra and that is the ""Camera Assistant"" - it's just not there....??? Just to let you know I'm in the UK. Strange."
H93pl8i-pJk,SUBBED!!
H93pl8i-pJk,"I don't care if you got paid to advertise good lock because getting my navigation settings back to legacy was worth it! Other tips were helpful too, like using routines 5:24"
H93pl8i-pJk,"Brilliant - Fantastic - Thanks for showing us the Hidden Gems .. 

Amazing but I could not find that camera Assist setting in my S24 ultra"

H93pl8i-pJk,Fantastic video for a fantastic phone

H93pl8i-pJk,"I’m thinking I don’t want to change settings where I’m not supposed to lol That to me is like popping the hood of my car and start tinkering! Since I have no knowledge of how it works I’d screw it up and it would cost me more in repairs. But to those that don’t care, great video. lol"
H93pl8i-pJk,Amazing
H93pl8i-pJk,How do you get the vertical scroll app drawer?? Please
H93pl8i-pJk,"Amazing video, though erase the AI watermark with AI. Better with the Object Draft tool, which does it much better."
H93pl8i-pJk,Plz..Samsung s24altra bixby uses

H93pl8i-pJk,"To short for novice wait for an update to get the best out of drawings capable, unique ❤please have a follow up...looking forward"
H93pl8i-pJk,"Loved the video!  Please be aware how distracting it is to use the phrase, ""go ahead"" almost constantly."
H93pl8i-pJk,"The gestures tip was helpful! The new gestures are annoying because if you get too close to the edge, you'll back while scrolling."
H93pl8i-pJk,Well that was clear ✨📢👌
H93pl8i-pJk,Thank you
H93pl8i-pJk,I've saved this video to watch it just after buying s24 ultra and after 1.5 years later watching it from s24 ultra when s25 launched and it's been months 😂😂
H93pl8i-pJk,Nice one
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus is too good it justified it's price ❤
HNJkJB8_XE8,1+ trying best with its budget..... Best of luck oneplus
HNJkJB8_XE8,I think the fact that it's hard to make a decision is incredible considering the price difference.
HNJkJB8_XE8,I'm s24 ultra user....still saying one plus 12 is also a good phone.....exact half price of s24ultra....
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus 12 😍⚡
HNJkJB8_XE8,"They’re both really good, now it’s a matter of taste. I hope you post more comparisons of those two phones!"
HNJkJB8_XE8,As a Photographer i have to say the oneplus is much better. No ugly hdr look. The Samsung is a great Smartphone camera but the oneplus is a good camera overall
HNJkJB8_XE8,The fact that OnePlus 12 can compete/comparable against double price phone is just awesome 😎
HNJkJB8_XE8,S24 ultra❤
HNJkJB8_XE8,"In India (and probably other locations too), S24 Ultra is exactly twice the price of Oneplus 12.
The marginal difference in picture quality does not justify the price tag of Samsung.
The bigger battery, Fast Charging and the 100W Charger in box itself are certainly big advantages with Oneplus.

About durability, I am still using Oneplus 6T for more than 5 years now and it still has no issues whatsoever.
SD845 still performs superbly fast (for gaming as well).
Had it supported 5G and wasn't stuck with Android 11(last official update-year2021), I wouldn't have even thought about upgrading it."
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus 12R is really unbelievable for the price it goes for🔥👌
HNJkJB8_XE8,"If S pen and/or the various AI features are not a must,  then Oneplus is really a no brainer"
HNJkJB8_XE8,I have been using a OnePlus 12 for almost 10 months now and it's a fantastic experience using it. It is defeated by some smartphones in some categories but overall it's a very good phone with their price ❤.
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus is best for its price... Ultra is just too over priced
HNJkJB8_XE8,"very close performance, Samsung has more hdr with blueish sky and in the ultrawide shot there's some weird processing in the floor. Oneplus has a more natural, less contrasty look"
HNJkJB8_XE8,Mene liya hal ...bhaiii next level camera and bettey OnePlus ❤🔥🔥
HNJkJB8_XE8,"OnePlus 12 is good in photos , battery , heat management and main thing is speed and responsive , I have experienced both"
HNJkJB8_XE8,"I choose the One Plus for a lower price and more features, and the most important thing is that the Oxygenos has a smooth and premium look compared to OneUI"
HNJkJB8_XE8,"S24 Ultra pics are more crisp, but still amazing on how a phone that's almost half the price less can do such well. I remember OnePlus cameras being horrible. They're better now."
HNJkJB8_XE8,"I own the OnePlus 12 and it's just amazing, especially its camera. iPhone(ultra pro max infinity) users ask me to click their pics."
HNJkJB8_XE8,Which is batter ??
HNJkJB8_XE8,"I used OnePlus 10 pro like 14/15 month, i can say it's a good camera phone according to the price"
HNJkJB8_XE8,Bro do iqoo 12 vs OnePlus 12 day 12 asking for comparison
HNJkJB8_XE8,"I have both ! The s24 Ultra feels and looks more premium. The screen looks way better and more flat. The OnePlus 12 feels like the OnePlus 9 pro which I have. But side by side the 12 is way brighter and more vibrant. The OnePlus 12 battery last a long time. I charged both phones at 7am and have 20 percent at 11 am at night without charging once.  The 12 charges faster , but s24 Ultra charges in full at about 1 hr and 12 min , it seems to charge faster at times. 12 charges at full in 30 sometimes 35 . But something about the 12 in the green is beautiful to look at. But unfortunately very slippery, so I'm using a full body case on both. The 12 has some crazy features. Allowing you to take storage and add to ram among other stuff. I still think the company OnePlus beats everyone even Samsung. Just the price and what you get. But the Samsung AI is interesting. It will tell me things about the weather and when it will change and what time. Both you can't go wrong with 🤝👍✌️"
HNJkJB8_XE8,899€ vs 1300€
HNJkJB8_XE8,ما تخلي رايك يكون فورة لبن بكره غينشن لكن ممكن تتحسن ترجع شغف او ممكن بعد فترة تطفش من ويزرنق تلعب غينشن خلي الاحتمالات متاحة اي لعبة عندا ميزات تختلف من تانية
HNJkJB8_XE8,"Oneplus is not bad when it comes to budget. But from personal experience, Samsung phones are far more reliable and lasts a whole lot longer."
HNJkJB8_XE8,One and only one plus 12 nice phone ❤❤❤
HNJkJB8_XE8,oneplus 🔥
HNJkJB8_XE8,According to budget OnePlus is performing well.
HNJkJB8_XE8,"Oneplus 12 definitely is worth for money, but in that price range you can already buy The Vivo x100 pro"
HNJkJB8_XE8,s24 uitra ❤
HNJkJB8_XE8,S24U is a bit sharper but only slightly. Otherwise its really just prefrence.
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus has a pretty decent camera for it's price.
HNJkJB8_XE8,Everyone is falling for the camera but what about recording videos from YouTube?
HNJkJB8_XE8,Good Job one plus 12 s24 ultra is the best
HNJkJB8_XE8,Im sitting here wondering why those city photos look familiar I know that place 😂😂😂
HNJkJB8_XE8,Samsung s24 ultra 🎉 much better 🎉
HNJkJB8_XE8,Best value for money Flagship 2024 OnePlus 12
HNJkJB8_XE8,"Вроде фотки на Самсунге чуть лучше, но они, как всегда, какие-то плоские. Поэтому OnePlus очень даже хорош"
HNJkJB8_XE8,My eyes goes towards the plus 12... Hand it over Mister. ☠️💀😁
HNJkJB8_XE8,Samsung results really has ULTRA post processing in their image....
HNJkJB8_XE8,How is this even a debate 😅😅
HNJkJB8_XE8,S24 is better but OnePlus is winner according to it's price
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus 12 is doing way better in under $1000 flagship
HNJkJB8_XE8,"The S24 ultra is better but it's more expensive I'm not spending that much, I have a OnePlus 12"
HNJkJB8_XE8,I know Downtown Newark when I see it! 😅😅
HNJkJB8_XE8,200mp/50mp/12mp?
HNJkJB8_XE8,s24u cover brand and model anyone ?
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus ❤❤❤❤❤
HNJkJB8_XE8,I have a S24 ultra. I 100% made the wrong choice. It's slower charging for me playing Pokemon go alot is killing me. Also doesn't last very long while I'm trying to grind
HNJkJB8_XE8,Oneplus is best phone 👌👌
HNJkJB8_XE8,Samsung should know what to do if not there product will be useless in future
HNJkJB8_XE8,Oneplus 12 ❤
HNJkJB8_XE8,"S24 Ultra is better, but the OnePlus cost almost a half 😅"
HNJkJB8_XE8,Samsung always sharpens pictures and makes them look less natural.
HNJkJB8_XE8,S24 ultra лучший телефон что у меня был !!!
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus 12 is good 🎉
HNJkJB8_XE8,#oneplus is best
HNJkJB8_XE8,Oneplus❤
HNJkJB8_XE8,Oneplus e mai ieftin și bun ❤
HNJkJB8_XE8,"The S24 Ultra is  the better camera overal, it has better HDR, shadows, edge detection etc and it has a 200MP camera so it has more detail than the oneplus 12"
HNJkJB8_XE8,Eu tenho oneplus 11 em breve terei o 12😊
HNJkJB8_XE8,"Scamsung never again, moved to OnePlus 12 after selling my s25 ultra now I got the one plus 13 and it wiped the floor with scamsung"
HNJkJB8_XE8,Watching thik shorts in oneplus12😂
HNJkJB8_XE8,Wow!
HNJkJB8_XE8,Is anyone seeing any difference other than the contrast
HNJkJB8_XE8,S24 ultra
HNJkJB8_XE8,For half of the price
HNJkJB8_XE8,I use oneplus 12😊
HNJkJB8_XE8,OnePlus 12 please
HNJkJB8_XE8,I just bought my phone one plus 12 512 gb iPhone is the same thing every year so now I’m switching from iPhone 12 Pro Max for the one plus 12
HNJkJB8_XE8,"Anyone in EU getting a S24 with that trash chipset is the biggest fool. Keep giving a company that basically said ""****** EU"" your money."
HNJkJB8_XE8,One plus ne dho dala s24 ultra ko overpriced samsung🎉🎉🎉
HNJkJB8_XE8,Samsung is best

HNJkJB8_XE8,One + 12
HNJkJB8_XE8,"The S24 series is the king of Smartphones, Google it and even Google put the S24 series as the overal top 1 best phone and, Samsung ecosystem is better because everything in your house can be bought from samsung and can be connected even your Samsung Toaster can take 200mp photos and your Samsung Refrigerator can talk and take a screenshot , Samsung is the better choice"
HNJkJB8_XE8,selfies
HNJkJB8_XE8,"Fake hai video,  😂 s24 king of camera"
HNJkJB8_XE8,I have s22 ultra and tbh it has the worst camera. The videos are too noisy.
HNJkJB8_XE8,Are u blind. Some say oneplus looks good ? Can't u see the image clarity?
HNJkJB8_XE8,not much difference
HNJkJB8_XE8,1+12 will be a nice one when the price drops to 500$ maximum
HNJkJB8_XE8,At night Oneplus12 sucks
HNJkJB8_XE8,Only a bit change for paying double amount pitty on samsung fraudsters

Od9F_9guCrY,bro was running split programs during s24 benchmark 😂
Od9F_9guCrY,The samsung charged faster with the screen on and running 2 apps at the same time. iPhone would've gotten obliterated if both were on AOD.
Od9F_9guCrY,"Turn of the battery life thing in the settings. After the 80% of charging, it getting slower step by step."
Od9F_9guCrY,My mother bought an iPhone 15 pro max but the battery life was not as good as I thought. I find that the nature of Android still allows for longer usage time
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung 💪
Od9F_9guCrY,its called optimised battery charging it slows down after 80% to prevent battery damage
Od9F_9guCrY,"xiaomi with a volume of 5000 in 18 minutes, and a charger included 🗿"
Od9F_9guCrY,"I think its not fair. Iphone have a slow charging at the end like a feature, and samsung works with launched stopwatch"
Od9F_9guCrY,You better have the right cable for the 45 watt charging on the ultra
Od9F_9guCrY,You can’t do a fair test with 2 different chargers. Plus the software on the iPhone changes the battery at a rate that’s best for the total lifetime of the battery. If you use a mA meter you’ll see that the iPhone will vary the charging state through out the charging cycle.
Od9F_9guCrY,So why would you have one screen on and not the other? How much sense does that make?
Od9F_9guCrY,I don’t care about change time. I charge my 15 pro max at night and I have yet to kill it in a day. The battery life is insane!!!
Od9F_9guCrY,SAMSUNG GALAXY S24 ULTRA ❤❤❤❤❤
Od9F_9guCrY,I also use samsung but gives a very slow charge after 90 percent charge in Apple because to avoid battery damage
Od9F_9guCrY,"yo, why do you always have samsung on multitasking for the stopwatch?? iphone screen is locked whilst s24 ultra is unlocked with two apps running simultaneously. same thing when it was a comparison between z fold 5 and one plus open, use a third phone as a stopwatch to make it less bias"
Od9F_9guCrY,Bro was running split screen and still won 💀💀💀💀
Od9F_9guCrY,The Samsung Won and even multi task stop watch and Battery.The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is the king of Smartphones It has Build in Ai🔥🔥And it has a Anti-Reflecting display/Screen.
Od9F_9guCrY,Bro was using stopwatch in S24 but still its charged faster 😮
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung 👌
Od9F_9guCrY,Beautiful! I have an S24 Ultra! NICE VIDEO! 😊
Od9F_9guCrY,Now do a battery drain test
Od9F_9guCrY,"The samsung :1:13:22
The iphon :2:22:11
Samsung is the best ❤🤜🤛💪💪"
Od9F_9guCrY,Which adapter we should buy for samsung galaxy 24 ultra
Od9F_9guCrY,"The starting horn of Gran Turismo 6, how nostalgic"
Od9F_9guCrY,"В айфоне есть такая функция «Оптимизированная зарядка», где он заряжает до 80% быстро, свыше 80% долго, чтобы не уничтожить быстро аккумулятор. Если выключить эту функцию, то и выше 80% он будет заряжать быстрее. Еще разница в пропускной способности напряжения и тока в проводе и в блоках питания, разная мощность, наверное. У меня iphone 13 заряжается за 50минут с оригинальным блоком питания в 25вт от 10-80%, а есть еще Redmi note 11pro 5G, так он с 67вт оригинальным блоком питания за 45 минут заряжается до 1-100%. Так что даже самсунг ваш от редми моего далек по скорости зарядки, а в топовом сяоми со 120вт мощности блока питания- так вообще еще больше зверем будет в скорости зарядки"
Od9F_9guCrY,"Good job, but the faster you charge, the more you stress the battery."
Od9F_9guCrY,strong battery and fast charge
Od9F_9guCrY,for iphone it is designed to slow down the charging speed to help sustain the battery health in a good way
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👌👌💪💪💪
Od9F_9guCrY,Please turn off the Optimized battery charging
Od9F_9guCrY,it's such a flex that samsung can do two things at the same time...
Od9F_9guCrY,"Samsung always was on top of Apple in features since the galaxy S3, but the Touch Wiz really held it back, now with One UI Samsung went better and better"
Od9F_9guCrY,هذا وانت مشغل تطبيقات في سامسونج 😂😂
Od9F_9guCrY,"я уверен на все 100 что в айфоне была включена функция сбалансированной зарядки, которая специально замедляет зарядку после 80%, чтобы телефон был заряжен как раз к началу вашего пользования, для сохранения состояния акб"
Od9F_9guCrY,that's why i love samsung ❤
Od9F_9guCrY,Bro running Clock on S24U in split screen makes the phone give extra work while charging while apple do nothing but charging anyway
Od9F_9guCrY,My OnePlus charging 20 minutes. He have 150 watt charging
Od9F_9guCrY,thats a good way to fuck up your charger port by snapping the charger in at an angle like that
Od9F_9guCrY,"Samsung 01:11
Iphone 02:22
❤😂😂😂😂😂
Samsung Win🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉"
Od9F_9guCrY,Is it used or not bc that isn’t fair comparison plus what wattage is it?
Od9F_9guCrY,iphones Battery Backup is much better than Samsung 😌
Od9F_9guCrY,How many watts should the Samsung be put in?
Od9F_9guCrY,"The main thing is not how fast it charges, but how slowly it discharges) Although I am a Samsung user since 23 ultra, I envy my sister. She has an iPhone 14 pro max, and charges her phone 1 time a day. And I do it 2 times a day 🤷"
Od9F_9guCrY,"Considering they almost has identical battery life, that 1hour is a huge difference 😂"
Od9F_9guCrY,"Может попробуешь оригинальной эйполовской зарадкой на 3,5 зарядить?!"
Od9F_9guCrY,"I don't know why people even compare it at this point, s24 ultra has proven multiple times it is more faster and lasts longer"
Od9F_9guCrY,All ppl in comments clearly clueless of how iphone battery works. Gl poor fellas.
Od9F_9guCrY,"A bad comparison if the one device is not in standby because it has to show the timer all the time.The LTPO panel cannot regulate this, as can the processor.The result is all the more impressive, but fair test methods still have to be worked on."
Od9F_9guCrY,I feel sorry for iphone users while samsumg is soo much better
Od9F_9guCrY,"the iphone is only slower because the always on display is on and optimized battery charging is on, which means it charges it slower when it goes past 80% which also protects the batterys long life health."
Od9F_9guCrY,"Iphone charging after 80% just takes 1watt of power because it takes lot of time from 80% to 100% 
For anyone who doesn’t know why they design like this : is because they they prevent users to charge after 80% so that phone battery life last longer."
Od9F_9guCrY,Bhai timer to samsung s24 ultra me laga tha tabhi bhi itni fast charging 😮❤
Od9F_9guCrY,"Please, turn off the “Optimized charging” on iPhone and do it again…."
Od9F_9guCrY,I still love iPhone 🔥♥️🇳🇬
Od9F_9guCrY,Slower charging = slower draining of the battery.
Od9F_9guCrY,Don’t you Samsung users think it’s a little weird how he used DIFFERENT charging bricks on both of them? He used a 65w on the Iphone but didn’t show what the wattage was on the Samsung 🤨
Od9F_9guCrY,Make a video on battery draining not gaining
Od9F_9guCrY,"It is so funny how no one in the comments knows what they are talking about. Yeah, the Samsung is multitasking during the charge but the iPhone has optimised charging setting on. The iPhone would have charged faster and after that, drained the battery slower 😂"
Od9F_9guCrY,"Все таки айфон лутше 
Не согласен = 🤡"
Od9F_9guCrY,"The samsung: 🟫
The bye bye bye got me💀"
Od9F_9guCrY,why uh test with the timer on at the same phone 😂
Od9F_9guCrY,"Desativa o carregamento otimizado, depois de certo nivel de carga o iphone tenta segurar para não subir carga, para prolongar a vida útil da bateria"
Od9F_9guCrY,Song?
Od9F_9guCrY,Sản phẩm quá tuyệt vời ❤  . Samsung galaxy s24 ultra ❤
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung❤
Od9F_9guCrY,You accidentally got a slow adapter.
Od9F_9guCrY,Why does the iPhone have no Fast charging like 65watts???
Od9F_9guCrY,Nah even galaxy s24 ultra gave iPhone a headstart💀
Od9F_9guCrY,Rip but only 4 iPhone owner.....🤣😂😁☠️💀
Od9F_9guCrY,Ugreen nexode rg 65 watt does it safe for samsung s24 ultra and support super fast charging2.0?
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung the best phone
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung galaxy s24 sản phẩm tốt chất lượng cao ae❤❤❤❤❤❤
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung 👍👍👍
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung s24 Ultra number 1 phone
Od9F_9guCrY,i phone user::: अबे जल्दी कर सुबह पनवेल निकलना ह 😂😂😂
Od9F_9guCrY,they're like cousins 😭💞
Od9F_9guCrY,"Samsung ✅️
IPhone ❎️"
Od9F_9guCrY,iPhone da pil sağlığı için %80den sonra yavaş şarj et özelliği açık😅😅
Od9F_9guCrY,Xiaomi 14 ultra 128w charger for 15 70%😂😂
Od9F_9guCrY,"Well, the Samsung has a bigger battery compared to the 15 pro max. Please let the iPhone breathe, it's a loved phone."
Od9F_9guCrY,60 hz iPhone>>>>>>>120 hz Samsung 😂
Od9F_9guCrY,i appreciate that the iPhone is slower. id rather have a phone that takes 2h to charge but a battery that won't need replacement every year rather than charging 0-100 in less than 30 minutes and kill the battery health. also because I'm still using 10W charging adapters and have 0 intention on buying new ones 😂
Od9F_9guCrY,Damn samsung is slow but iPhone is slowest
Od9F_9guCrY,"I have a Samsung Ultra 24 and I have a 66W fast charger from Realme, but the device is charging slowly. Why?"
Od9F_9guCrY,Both phones are GREAT!🤩
Od9F_9guCrY,"Друг заряжал зарядкой 67 ватт и у него батарея стала плохо держать через 2 года уже.  
Кто не боится замены акб, может смело выпендриваться перед айфоном."
Od9F_9guCrY,So what was the price of s24 ultra again?
Od9F_9guCrY,"Bro iPhone optimised charging is on, that’s the reason why it’s late to be fully charged"
Od9F_9guCrY,"Lies, my iPhone 15, on the original charger, charges in 30 minutes, the author simply does not know what “autonomous charging” is and provided that the Apple company takes care of its battery, it made the maximum energy consumption 20 watts, so the test is not fair at least good luck to everyone☺️"
Od9F_9guCrY,multitasking was personal 😏
Od9F_9guCrY,"Actually, the iPhone starts charging slower after 80%, because it saves battery"
Od9F_9guCrY,Can you put Red Mgaic 9S Pro Plus💀
Od9F_9guCrY,"Ok, lets see how much time work they are :) ?"
Od9F_9guCrY,how many watts are the chargers?
Od9F_9guCrY,Remember the wattage of the plug means nothing if you're phone cant support it
Od9F_9guCrY,"You should turn off the screen to test, or also use Samsung's AOD display."
Od9F_9guCrY,What watt charger should use for samsung s24 ultra
Od9F_9guCrY,Gave my cousin an adaptive fast charger off Amazon with a USBC to iphone cord I somehow had. He was shocked at how fast it charged. And that wasn't even 45w cause iphone doesn't want you to have that. 😅
Od9F_9guCrY,Samsung galaxy S24 tốt chất lượng ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Od9F_9guCrY,The Sammy might have charged faster But the iPhone has the better longevity in battery use
0JFGiWNuJek,The black is the best one. All the other colors are good but I personally like the black the best.

E4zTQL6jMyU,I've been using Spigen card cases since my S8 plus days. Every Galaxy I've owned up to my current S24 Ultra all got the Spigen card case treatment.
E4zTQL6jMyU,Ultra hybrid 0 one so gooooddddd
E4zTQL6jMyU,I have titanium zero one but read the difference between the and the black is the grip I had known before I switched to the black. 😅
E4zTQL6jMyU,I'm grabbing the last one.
E4zTQL6jMyU,Ultra Hybrid Zero One 🗿🔥
E4zTQL6jMyU,Spigen is my go to case for every time i buy a new phone
E4zTQL6jMyU,Enzo Aramid Was The Best...💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
E4zTQL6jMyU,I just got the regular clear Case from spigen also with the s24 Ultra
E4zTQL6jMyU,"I have all of them, but my favorite is the enzo"
E4zTQL6jMyU,Which did you choose to use?
E4zTQL6jMyU,I have the Zero One it fits like a glove ❤
E4zTQL6jMyU,S24+❤
E4zTQL6jMyU,"Best cases in this video based on design:


1. Ultra Hybrid Zero One
2. Liquid Slot
3. Enzo Amarid

Edit: This isn't even a tier list I just typed almost all of the cases in the video 💀"
E4zTQL6jMyU,The ultra hybrid zero one looks much better.
E4zTQL6jMyU,YES.
E4zTQL6jMyU,"They look nice but will not protect the phone. A day after I purchased a Spigen case and installed it, the phone fell 2 feet from the sofa, and the S23 Ultra shattered. Never again. Wrote to Spigen, and they never responded."
E4zTQL6jMyU,Can we put aftermarket camera lens protector on any of these cases?
E4zTQL6jMyU,That one card holding ahh wtf lol
