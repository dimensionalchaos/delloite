fFCGtAmse5c,"Thank you for this!  I'm 77rrs old and I really needed the help.  My 'digital Grans and great grans don't come up to the country often, I would be lost if I hadn't found your channel.  You earned my 'subscribe!'    I dropped my A12 and it didn't survive  but this phone is all this old man needs. 🤠"
fFCGtAmse5c,The color reminds me of the Samsung Note 10+ Aura Glow. It's beautiful. The bottom speaker cutout also matches the new S24 series. Anyway great video!
fFCGtAmse5c,I upgraded to this phone from my Samsung A11❤  It's so good alongside with my Tab A9 Plus!
fFCGtAmse5c,It's a good affordable phone for the average person. I think spending lots of money on a phone is dumb.
fFCGtAmse5c,That fact that you can get a phone this good for that price is absolutely insane.
fFCGtAmse5c,That color is beautiful it's like the prism white from the s10 series.
fFCGtAmse5c,Apple should learn a thing or two from a under $200 phone about how to provide higher refresh rate display in their Non-pro line-up 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,"A bit late, but i guess I'll say my opinion. 

The A15 5g is most likely going to be one of Samsung's best selling smartphones, especially after all the upgrades. 

The biggest upgrade with the A15 is the display, no doubt. AMOLED is such a improvement, not just for gamers, but for everyday users alike due to much better color saturation and deeper blacks. The 90Hz also helps. 

Performance wise, the 128GB base storage option is very nice, the chipset ain't going to impress everyone, but its good enough for simple gaming and everyday browsing. 

Design wise, its nice and cool for most people. 

The only thing that turns people away from it is speakers and video, the speaker isn't great, dual speakers is great for music and the fact its capped on 30 fps 1080p video is upsetting. I mean i don't hate the fact that its resolution is 1080p, its just if your going to cap it on FHD, At least give a 60 fps option. 

For the price, its a very good value phone, and will still hold up in the future (Especially compared to the A05)"
fFCGtAmse5c,I will be upgrading to this phone from my tracfone journey LG. Great review.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Yes, I did purposely make this video 15 minutes long *(A15)* My A55 unboxing next week will be 55 minutes long 👀

fFCGtAmse5c,"Bought this and loving it.

Only thing is I'm not able to have my YouTube notifications pop up on my notifications bar. I've checked all my settings and notifications are allowed .... so"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Working wireless, the budget phones were always the most exciting. Seeing people who cannot afford much get better features each year was nice to see. Especially when Samsung went from the A12 to A13. Phone went from awful to useable. A14 got better and hit 1080p, but now with more ram if you get those models these phones should hopefully be able to just work now."
fFCGtAmse5c,6:24 How are you supposed to listen to calls without a speaker near selfie camera?
fFCGtAmse5c,"Another great vid Wade!

This is such an awesome value... Samsung really killed it this year on the A15.  They did really well in choosing the right trade-offs for most people, while still keeping it at this very affordable price point."
fFCGtAmse5c,It would be nice if you could do a software comparison to more expensive samsung phones. Interested to see what they've omitted.
fFCGtAmse5c,I just ordered one of these the other day switchinf from my 6 year old Motorola that started having issues a couple months ago. I'm so frustrated with! Thank you for this video.
fFCGtAmse5c,"I was going to buy a much more expensive phone but I’m quite happy with this! I’m not gaming, or even phoning much. And I’m usually at home so I can use my home internet with the apps.❤🇨🇦"
fFCGtAmse5c,"This is unrelated but this is what I think a killer S24 FE would be: Even Bezels they don’t have to be that thin kinda like s21 fe side bezels, Snapdragon gen 2, 5000mah, fix that silver ring around the front camera and make it look like the other flagships, also the cameras can be slightly improved but they already are pretty decent. Although I don’t think Samsung would ever do something this ambitious. Overall great video on the A15 5g!"
fFCGtAmse5c,This phone paired with the LG Gram Style 16 laptop is just perfect
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm tempted to buy this as a backup.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Not talking about this phone but still budget Samsung related, I actually have a Galaxy Tab A7 Lite lying around which I got during my early uni years and just days before it received the One UI 6.0 update as well. Mind you it was released back in June 2021 and it still gets OS updates (which I thought One UI Core 5.0 was going to its last update before Samsung forgets about this tablet.) It's a fairly slow device, but with its price it is such a wonderful media consumption device. With 3rd party equalizers the built in speakers are actually nice. When I bought it  I really didnt expect it to be supported for such a long time."
fFCGtAmse5c,History will be made when Samsung finally decides to put punch hole display 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm getting it on April 10th only 1 months so excited
fFCGtAmse5c,This is my phone now and im so inlove with it. ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,This is by far the best easily! And the colour i got mine is the same light blue it's got the ethereal touch
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just got mine yesterday, and so far I love the panel, 5g and 50mp camera. I'm more than willing to deal with the single speaker and poor video quality"
fFCGtAmse5c,The samsung galaxy a15 5g awesome phone the color is similar to the samsung galaxy s10 plus prism white and the samsung galaxy note 10 and 10+ and not bad at all
fFCGtAmse5c,Best review so far well explained without pressure ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm watching on a a15 😂😂😂
fFCGtAmse5c,I love the fact that you are always so honest when reviewing phones.
fFCGtAmse5c,Play tech daily my name each. Me purchased the A15-5G. From Metro by T-Mobile. Tanks dis video iss very very helpful. I love ya Content plz keep pit up.
fFCGtAmse5c,If you only used your phone to watch YouTube and check emails would you buy the A15 or the A05s? Im being forced to uprage from my nokia G20 due to 3g no longer being supported.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Man, you're right on time with this one! I'm currently sitting behind my computer deciding on Samsung Galaxy A15 5G vs Motorola Moto G Play (2024) vs OnePlus Nord N30 5G. Which one would you recommend? I need something cheap and basic, mainly for calls and looking up stuff online occasionally."
fFCGtAmse5c,watching this in my samsung a15 !!
fFCGtAmse5c,"Seems like a nice change from my A10E, that clearly needs an upgrade watching the screen go bezerk."
fFCGtAmse5c,I see that international version of Samsung A25 is sold cheaper and just 50 more than A15. Despite that Exynos has bad rep it is still faster than Dimensity 6100+.
fFCGtAmse5c,I don’t understand how the a11 and a12 had hole punch selfie camera and had thinner bezels.
fFCGtAmse5c,Why my samsung a15 lte doesn't have  a video stabilization like yours? Where I can find? Is there any set about it?
fFCGtAmse5c,"i hope for their future a16, they do the punch hole in the side like what they did to a11"
fFCGtAmse5c,I absolutely love my Samsung A15 4G 128GB . I am going to purchase the Samsung A15 5G 256GB version and the Samsung A25 5G 256GB version.
fFCGtAmse5c,"I go one android than an iPhone then android then iPhone.

These android phones are getting better and better for a low price.

Moto G73 ATM. I'm happy"
fFCGtAmse5c,Ironically I just got the Samsung galaxy a14 5g. And I love it. 😂😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
fFCGtAmse5c,"This is (compared to A14) big upgrade to A10 series. I wanted to buy A14 5G but no ultra-wide camera, slow as f charging and goofy bezels was big no. Now this is all fixed with A15 5G :D"
fFCGtAmse5c,there is a secondary speaker you couldn't do phone calls without it. But its not configured as stereo speakers.
fFCGtAmse5c,I have a older A51 do you think this would be a good enough phone for me to buy or should I spend alot more money and buy a new A55 because they are very pricey in Canada 🇨🇦
fFCGtAmse5c,Why didn't it come with screen recording
fFCGtAmse5c,"I have one. It's my first ever Samsung. It's okay. It lags but it's good for 270 CAD. The camera is descent. Annyoing things: common lag, huge bezels, U shaped notch, etc. I am switching to a Galaxy A55 soon. Overall okay. Not a very fluid phone, but the rest is okay."
fFCGtAmse5c,Is this phone for recording videos?
fFCGtAmse5c,My new mobile
fFCGtAmse5c,In my region I have the 4g variant. Whats your opinion about that?
fFCGtAmse5c,"My personal phone is a samsung S24 , iv had it a while and was ready to upgrade when my work gave me a new A15, i think its a great lil phone, im actually considering getting A15 as my personal fone lol"
fFCGtAmse5c,A 15 5 is a masterpiece from samsung ❤❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,I have a a51 and I think I might get this new a15 just because of the price the new a 55 5G in Canada 🇨🇦 now is like 600 dollars its getting up there so I think I'll go with the a15 great video and thank you
fFCGtAmse5c,The first thing is 6.5 or even less is the best size for any cell phone
fFCGtAmse5c,I ordered mine free through my carrier. As long as I had service and a certain plan. Was looking into a new budget friendly phone.
fFCGtAmse5c,"Does it have ""Data switching and backup calling""?"
fFCGtAmse5c,Just got my own today
fFCGtAmse5c,"Does it only take one sim?...
If yes do they have the one that takes 2 sims"
fFCGtAmse5c,YES i waited so much for u to do this video W VIDEO MAN
fFCGtAmse5c,Oof nice phone. i’m going to get one on 2024 christmas man 🎄
fFCGtAmse5c,❤ Love it. Huge improvements in memory capacity & screen over A14.
fFCGtAmse5c,is it water proof?
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm always on the go is this phone good to watch movies? Does it have Dolby Atmos? How is the screen resolution  and does it take good pictures and videos??
fFCGtAmse5c,I wish they bring back A11 front camera design for their upcoming entry level phone
fFCGtAmse5c,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not really major"
fFCGtAmse5c,I love your videos today I'm gonna get two one for my wife and one for her daughter❤❤❤❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,One speaker two speakers it doesn’t matter because anyone who listens to music through the speakers on their phone should have their ears cut off
fFCGtAmse5c,"Somehow this phone's display is better than the one on my a54. My a54 has terrible viewing angles, tilting the screen ever so slightly gives the screen a green cast, and whites look weird, kind of greenish, if you squint, it's because there are tiny green and purple pixels scattered on the display. None of that was present in the a15's display, whites look actually white and more comforting to the eye, viewing angles are not as bad, i didn't see the weird scattered green and purple pixels, and yeah in general the difference was night-and-day"
fFCGtAmse5c,Thanks. I only came here for the apps pre installed ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,"Waiting for a A25 review
Idk when, But im gonna wait."
fFCGtAmse5c,I have it for some time now and while the screen is excellent the overall design is horrible. They put the power button on the side barely extruding so it's extremely hard to click it. Most of the time I need to look where is the button before clicking it. It's a shame because such a small thing is so frustrating. Can't wait to get rid of it unfortunately.
fFCGtAmse5c,I actually got this and my friends thought it is an samsung s24
fFCGtAmse5c,Price
fFCGtAmse5c,I AM watching on iPhone 12 mini 😅
fFCGtAmse5c,does it have adapter for charging?
fFCGtAmse5c,how long does the battery last
fFCGtAmse5c,"I have a A15 (mine’s the A154G with the Helio G99 though). 

The new A16 5G isn’t out in the U.S. yet though it is in the UK, India, Australia, Asia,etc-has 6 years software updates promise and the successor to the A15 5G."
fFCGtAmse5c,I BOUGHT IT THREE YEARS AGO AND IT IS VERY GOOD 👍
fFCGtAmse5c,If I had known of this phone sooner I would have never traded my s22 to get the Z Flip 5 I would have gone with this phone
fFCGtAmse5c,"When turn on the phone, why only showed samsung galaxy?? Why not samsung galaxy A15 5G?? 😮😮"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Could you do a video on how to ONLY use memory card NOT have photos go into my phone, PLEASE! 😊"
fFCGtAmse5c,I had came from the a21 to the a15 and I love the a15
fFCGtAmse5c,I have to phone for around 2 weeks. It work great for me because I am a truck driver so really all I do is watch YouTube and talk on the phone. The only issue I have had is some water splashed on it and the top camera(ultra wide) has some moisture in it. That makes the ultra wide pictures a little fuzzy. It also struggles with depth because of that. It's a great phone just don't get it wet at all!!!😂😂😂😂
fFCGtAmse5c,Where's adapter to charge the phone?It seems I didn't see an adapter in the video
fFCGtAmse5c,Is this colour only available in the US?
fFCGtAmse5c,I’m watching this while having a Gabb phone 4 pro 😭😂
fFCGtAmse5c,Finally a praise worthy review 🎉🎉
fFCGtAmse5c,I was offer a brand new ( unused) pixel 7 for the same Price as the A15 5g so what would be the best phone?? I have a lot of movie and tv series on the playstore lots of audiobook from audible and Watching youtube video
fFCGtAmse5c,"I want to buy this phone for my mom, she doesn't want a flagship phone, just a phone that will replace her old clunky galaxy A20. 😅"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Ive come to the realization that the A1 series of phones are usually begind about 5 years on Camera quality in relation to the flagship lineup... The camera in the A15 is pretty much equal to the camera in the Galaxy S10 phones. The A0 phones are about 7 years behind. With the A05S being level with the S7 or S8 phones. The A2 are about 3 years behind, A3s are about 2-3 years behind, and the A5s are only 1-2 years behind."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Those waching on 2025
⬇️"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Meanwhile in Australia, it’s $341 in the Samsung Australia Amazon store, but the far superior A35 only costs $100 more"
fFCGtAmse5c,"how to put applock in a15,  s secure is not working (stop in background)"
fFCGtAmse5c,I want to upgrade from samsung a 12 should i choose this or anathor company phone someone please reply ????
fFCGtAmse5c,"A25 is leagues better. It really is the best option this year so far. Please, if you're going to buy a budget samsung phone, please save your money up for atleast an A25 5G. If your looking for hardware which is near flagship material but with a headphone jack, I'd say the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 pro is a much better and cheaper option."
fFCGtAmse5c,"I wonder, will Americans consider this phone above the Iphone SE? Samsung's budget phones are getting better and better."
fFCGtAmse5c,"My uncle purchased the Indian retail unit of this in the blue black colour and I gave him a heads up on the technology side of a smartphone. He upgraded from a Nokia 6.2 so he definitely lost on the build quality, but he gained on a lot more aspects. I use an A34 5G [i wanted an A33 5g originally but got the middle variant of the same once i noted the improvements]."
fFCGtAmse5c,Does it have a screen recording feature?
fFCGtAmse5c,are they any good

qqnoDJcBJVk,Why do these people speak so fast especially when their accent makes them difficult to understand?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought this phone and it's crazy to me that this was a budget phone. I literally ordered it online, added a nice case and had it delivered in about 40 minutes... all for under $200 total. The amount of bang for your buck is pretty crazy and although I'm used to my iPad finger sensor location, I am really liking the feature built into the power button. Also, battery life matters to me and this is an upgrade over my last phone."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just got this phone. It's a very fast equipped phone when your on the go and in a fast pace environment. Like the fingerprint unlock feature is on point. The swiping on point too
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got mine for $128 out the door from T-Mobile today. I have an iPhone 11 and the A15 5G is definitely an upgrade.
MP-aGSJJsvk,The phone to get for people who want the features that matter the most to most smartphone users without wanting to pay up to $1000 more for any of the S24 models. I'd buy it.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Let’s be honest, for most people this phone checks all the boxes."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review! I have upgraded my Samsung A12 on this because it has 5G. Man, Samsung is very durable. My A12 is still good after 3 years of use. You can never go wrong with Samsung!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15... Got her today... On my hand the most beautiful creature made by Samsung. Love it. 😊😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got this phone free when changing service and went from an A53 5G to this. I know the A53 has better specs but with day to day use they seem about the same. I'll probably go back to my A53 just because the camera is better but other than that it would be hard to tell them apart. I think the fingerprint reader is better on the A15 and it has an actual headphone jack so those even things out a little.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I switched from S21 to this phone because of the longer battery, but it ticks all of the boxes I need for a phone. No need spending much and this phone doesnt need a cover"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"GSMARENA was my go to before the YouTube review era!!
Good to see you guys!!
Subbed!!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have been using it for 2 months. It's enough for most people.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got one a month ago and it is the best bang for your buck. The display is 🔥
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review. This A15 5G looks identical to my A25, but I am glad I bought the latter, the extra 50 bucks price difference seems to be worth it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I bought this phone just for my curiosity and it's pretty good aside from the meh camera quality. I own a Pixel 8 Pro and honestly this phone is pretty good for those on a very strict budget.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought the Galaxy A15 a few days ago and so far I like it. It's probably too early to say for sure but so far it's a pretty good phone. I bought the Samsung galaxy A20 around 3 years ago and I loved it! Until the screen pixels crapped out on me after 2 or 3 months. I paid $80 to repair the screen and the new screen crappmonths. after 6 months. I was soon mad!!! 😂😭😠 So,  I'll wait past 6 months to see how this version really works for me. 😅😊"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 User here. I'm super happy with it's recent updates, improving performance and so on."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was attacked and robbed recently of my S24 Ultra and Switch OLED and 1800 in cash. Needless to say, I needed to shop for a new phone but was determined to get an OLED screen. I got the A15 LTE for $199 in Canada. What an incredible phone and value. The S24 Ultra is 2 grand in Canada and this phone keeps up nicely and had Android 14 installed. 
Im grateful that Samsung has a cheaper line of phones but also that they are making them so well. 
Everything about this phone is incredible for 2 hundred bucks.
Spring for the 5G model though. I should have thrown in the extra 25. My LTE is a little slow at times."
MP-aGSJJsvk,In video speaker test like the old days! Classic 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Some corrections:
The A15 5G uses a different processer than the A15 4G. Both phones have OIS, not EIS, both phones get supported for 4 years OS updates, 5 years for security, and you can change the display colours on both devices,and both phones can take 50 mp photos for more detail which they didnt do in the camera test for some reason."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Galaxy A15 my dream phone 😍 cant wait to save money and buy this to play my favourite games, Pree Payyee and Pabjee Mobeel at 8k max settings 500fps wow"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Bought it yesterday and I'm in love with it perfect phone❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got it. Replacement for my overheated s21, its really good for a budget phone"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Most people using phones at this price range won't be needing the 5G speed, I appreciate the option thou, but getting the cheaper 4G model is probably the wiser choice."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Updated comment: Guess the issue at 3:22 verifies Notebookcheck's test of the A15 LTE having better UFS controllers than the 5G version.

Original comment: Any other complaints that aren't based on skill issues?😂
Some website said the 4G version has faster storage speed despite both models being UFS 2.2."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 5G was released march 2023 herr in Phil. I bought mine march31 2023. .and I am very satisfied for the quality. My friends went crazy when I use this under the rain 🤣🤣🤣 until now nothing change, it seems like brand new when it comes to phone overl all performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I love Samsung Galaxy A15 5G, I did some tests on it, didn't even break, I even poured water on it, didn't do ANY damage!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"It’s good to see Amoled screen on Samsung’s budget phones. However, I think I’m gonna wait for A55 if it has some interesting upgrade too."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got my Galaxy phone....loving it so far...
MP-aGSJJsvk,Dear Samsung please get rid of this dam notch.Bring the punch hole in all of your devices.It is a humble request
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This may be wrong of me to ask here but what about Angie? Like personally, are you guys still keep in touch with her? I know she moved on to start her own channel but she hasn't posted anything in a while. Both here and on her Instagram. I'm just worried about her. So please if you guys have any news, please share. Thank you."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching with my newly purchased Galaxy A15. 
I have both an Iphone and this, but I prefer to use this 🥰"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The one thing that I like about this phone and Samsung phones in general is the sound quality in videos, they sound pretty nice, my S20 FE captures sounds with great quality and I couldn't be more happier. This A15 has great quality sound in video as well."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for this review. I had to buy one 4 days ago, when the screen of my device which i had for almost 4 years gave out. I actually really like it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Yay ive been waiting for this video
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got mine yesterday and I really enjoy it. It's much faster than the a20 i had.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I will buy this phone end of may, from A03 to A15.
The best budget phone between A05s & A25"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why is the Samsung A15 4G faster than the A15 5G when I always hear that 5G connectivity phones are faster ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"My wife got this phone. A couple weeks in it started to get random issues locking up due to ghost touch, making the phone unusable until she restarts it. Seems to be a common issue online.

We're outside the 2 week return period, so now we need to try and bring it in the next time the issue shows up as they won't do anything unless they see the issue, but it happens sporadically and makes even restarting the phone difficult when it happens. A replacement might have the same issue so we were hoping to return the phone and go for a different model, but they said we have to go through warranty first.

Even the technician gave us a look the second he saw we had a A15 because he knew it was trouble.

Would not recommend this phone unless you don't mind your phone becoming unusable every once in a while."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Watching this on my Samsung A34. I love Samsung
MP-aGSJJsvk,0:45 I’m here to watch the great review on this phone I just found at $100 dollars and with all due respect I started to watch this video and I was thinking about the “uncle Roger”guy lol😜I hope you don’t get offended by my dumb comment 😮
MP-aGSJJsvk,Samsung did a good job for thier budget phones.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently just got the A15 4G
And I love it
I have no complains
It's fast and reliable.
I also play call of duty mobile with great frame rate and almost no lags
Tho lags are every endurable
It's the best budget phone I've ever used"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Nice review, many thanks. Apologies for my ignorance, but why would one need or prefer 4g vs 5g or vice versa? Thanks."
MP-aGSJJsvk,But how does it work as a telephone?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Hey I have this phone just 2 days ago!
It was a really good phone and I am gonna use this phone for my school thats gonna start in 4 more days
Really shines and does more!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why are they still releasing a separate 5g and 4g version? 5g stopped being a premium (or even midrange) feature years ago.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you so much Gsmarena
MP-aGSJJsvk,I saw a gunshop right across from your studio😂😂 5:29
MP-aGSJJsvk,Saw her for one second and have never been happier to get her back with me
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15 is basically A24 in disguise
MP-aGSJJsvk,Big fan of this video visual direction 🙏
MP-aGSJJsvk,THANK YOU SO MUCH 4 THE TOUR 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This phone impressed me! For an entry level, you can't go wrong with this!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got two for switching from Metro to T-mobile for free. They should be here Wed. Can't wait. My a12 is old and acting up and my daughter's A07 is definitely giving up the ghost; so prayerfully made the right choice.
MP-aGSJJsvk,1:50 i dont understand some phone companies the flagships won't have headphone Jacks but their mid-range will just keep the headphone jack all together
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got two of these phones for free with T-Mobile as a family plan and everyone satisfied I really like it
MP-aGSJJsvk,"im buying this phone soon, my dad has a phone like that and it is very great. I suggest ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently bought a Google Pixel 8 and bought an a15 for an emergency spare. The a15 does everything that the Google pixel 8 does, at least according to my needs (the camera on the Pixel 8 is better, however). I actually like the larger size of the a15, and for those who worry about the sturdiness of the case in the screen, you can get a rubberized case and screen covers for $10 or $15 total, making it hard to break. If I had to do it all over again, I would buy an a15 or an a25, and skip the pixel 8."
MP-aGSJJsvk,For what ive read its 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security patches.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have a midrange a73 5g since 2022. I must say its still good and i heavily use my phone on a daily basis
MP-aGSJJsvk,What a beauty 😍 i got mine last week 8gb 256gb rom 🎉
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought it today as a toy for my daughter. I got it brand new for $40 from walmart. It is locked to straighttalk. But who cares I am not putting a sim in it, as it is going to be used as a gaming phone by kids."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Getting mine on Friday ❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,The best phone ever I switched from iphone and it's hands down the best phone I ever used people paying all this money for iphones and flagship phones doesn't make sense
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got the A15 a few weeks ago and it runs so well.  A big upgrade from my Moto G Pure.  I got tired of Moto.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can you watch youtube videos while browsing or using other apps?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was looking for a s24, and the shopkeeper handed over A15 and s24, and i was surprised both of them looked same almost and similar features except the camera  quality (which i dont use) but with an enormous price difference."
MP-aGSJJsvk,My elder brother bought this for me 😊❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Where is the fingerprint secure at
MP-aGSJJsvk,I gave my daughter this phone hope she likes it❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Which is better to buy A15 4g or A15 5g
MP-aGSJJsvk,Good review. Happy with my A15. Battery life is awesome.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have recently bought the Samsung AO5s and Samsung A15 4G.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I've had a Galaxy A51 for a few years and I recently bought a A15 5g.I like it but my heart will always be with my A51 lol
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Bro samsung A34 or moto edge 40 neo ?
Which is best?"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you much for the info.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"i got this to replace my redmi 8 pro as the battery was dying. great phone, feels solid, camera is not as good as only 30fps but that doesnt bother me. has all the bells and whisltles like NFC. cant fault it for a £100 phone ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"bit confused as to the tone in this review compared to the 4G version, is the camera not the same? I watched it a few days ago (since thats the model I'm getting) and I remember him talking much more negatively about the camera"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can they use the same phone cases?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got one and love it. I beat my addiction of apple
MP-aGSJJsvk,Your nerdy ness helped me
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching from my A15 and I must say, it's just so good for its price"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you gsm
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does this device allow screen recording?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does this one have a screen recorder?
MP-aGSJJsvk,5:51 Uncle Roger???👀😳😜
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got one today, not upgraded since the A32 5g 3 years ago"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Great Phone i recently buy this and very smooth runing
MP-aGSJJsvk,Even my 3yr old Redmi note 9pro max doesn't lag
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you for this review. I found it most helpful. Gale
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Brought 4G of  this phone two weeks ago 160$ 6GB RAM and 128GB of ROM

PROS ARE
1 Amoled display but compared to other phones like even galaxy s8 it looks little cheap idk why. 
2 Battery is perfect it consume 10% every hour of screen time
3 One UI 6 is pretty good with no lag.
4 fingerprint scanner is very responsive and very fast i love it.

Cons 
1 No HDR support for display.

2 bulky design and applying case and screen protector make it very heavy.

3 No OIS or EIS for camera. And 50mp photos looks washed out front camera is taking good photos but looks unnatural.

4 phone back is plastic and fingerprint marks are very visible. After wiping it several times tiny scratches was visible which is not good. I applied plastic protection in the back to solve further scratches.

5 Front screen have no protection its normal glass I was very sad that it didn't have any type of glass  protection. So I applied screen protector to keep it safe."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I am liking the A15 for my use. But is there a way to adjust settings on  A15 to allow Gemini to read and send voice text.  My second phone is being used by person with AMD and Siri on an iPhone 7 used to assist that way?  We get informed that Gemini does not have permission?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just bought this for my son. Hope he likes it
MP-aGSJJsvk,The beat device I've ever bought 🎉❤❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have the ZFlip (2020) and I’m using it as a work phone. Should i upgrade to this one?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The A15 5G is not slower because it's a 5G model, it's because there was a firmware and software issue. This has now been fixed by Samsung."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Does the Samsung A15 5G version support 4G Sim Vards and does it have dual sim tray where i can put two sim cards and a micro sd card in the phone at te same time like in the Samsung A10
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank lots for sharing ♥️ 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,does it have smart view or screen mirror
MP-aGSJJsvk,Which games are u playing on Samsung a15 in this video?

pm9CYCllfFg,Outstanding Video! Just got a A15 & amazed at its capabilities. You are GREAT!...How about another Vid showing  'How to Transfer from Contacts List into 'Groups'. I can't get this to work....Thanks
pm9CYCllfFg,"Almost every single one of these was something new for me. And I actually changed at least 10 different things. But do you think you could make a video showing us how to change the character symbols' locations? On my keyboard, I hate that the question mark is so far away from the exclamation mark. On my old phone, it used to be right next to each other, but now they're on opposite sides of the keyboard. I know where in the settings it says to change it, but every time I try doing it, it's just really confusing, and I end up not changing anything."
pm9CYCllfFg,Thanks for this.
pm9CYCllfFg,"Love the traditional headphone jack, sd card."
pm9CYCllfFg,"Hi got this phone about 6 months ago ,but i can not get it to notify me of a voice mail . talk to straight talk they looked at there settings  said things was ok on there side . would you have any ideals what it might be ?"

pm9CYCllfFg,I'm still here. 🔥
pm9CYCllfFg,"Mr. Butler,
Hope all is well. After watching your video on the A15, I  was  so convinced as to which phone I was going to purchase...however when I  went to the Samsung website, I basically got talked out of the A15, and into the A25. PLEASE, I need your help/opinion/advice because I am older and not very tech savvy. I have scoured YouTube looking to see if you had a video similar to this one about the A15 but giving a review of the A25. PLEASE HELP,  I need to make my decision soon. Thx in advance 😊"
pm9CYCllfFg,im still  here 👍

pm9CYCllfFg,"Please, please, please can you help me? 1st of all I can do things however I need talking through it from start to finish, as you have brilliantly done in this video, and thanks for that. Right, how on earth do I get the phone to stop leaving (for E.G.) the 'Copied to clipboard' on the screen in the small grey box, it happens with other things also. I just can't get rid of it and it drives me mad! And another issue, how can you access the clipboard? Thanks in advance, MAH."
pm9CYCllfFg,Is there more than one way to do a screen shot. I find it very hard to do it. Thank you
pm9CYCllfFg,"Wich has better anc soundpeats space, Baseus h1i or qcy h3?"

pm9CYCllfFg,"I agree, don't put it on the dark screen"
pm9CYCllfFg,What does the button on the left with a small hole on the top of it do?

j7fsru9ak6M,MAAAANNNTAAAPPP 👍👍👍
j7fsru9ak6M,I got this today❤❤
j7fsru9ak6M,4g or 5g?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"A good enough phone for those who just need a basic smartphone with basic usage. Nothing fancy here, but still solid."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"just got the a15 5g ,had it about a week way less glitchy than my old nokia 100 , pretty good for a $150 phone im happy"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I got this phone for the basic smart phone features of apps for grocery shopping, qr code downloads for municipal transportation system real time operations Where is that train or bus? ).  Calculating out the cost savings in shopping with coupons, exceeded the cost upgrades for buying the phone.  It provides the basic phone services and that is all I want tor need from a smart phone."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Just bought one of these for my teenage son, his last phone unfortunately tanked. Really brilliant budget smart phone"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I bought the s20 fe this week  for the same price, and it's really good ,battery not the best but I'm planing to change it  ,I think buy old good phone better then new cheap phone 😊"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got A15, 5G today. I like it.."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Ive been using a15 for 1 month now and it's a great phone
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Good phone. Samsung's budget phones are becoming better. A few comments about the video. First, I'm happy you brought the speaker test sounds back. Second, you forgot about the selfie photo quality. But great review. Looking forward to that of the S24 ultra. Thanks."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"man headphone jack + microsd is wild to see today, and totally sells me on it"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"3:30 25W charging is a nice update, but no charger in the box. And I still thank Samsung for saving the world more."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I purchased one today and I am very happy. $170 out the door. Does the same thing as all the other Samsung phones, just a little slower. I love the single speaker at bottom. Very loud."
SuIl1KRWhSc,I bought this phone a few days ago and theres no complaints ❤😊
SuIl1KRWhSc,2:03 I'm so happy you brought this banger back♥️👑
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Many people just ask if it's this or that... You buy and see a cheap product with many updates, a nice design and a relatively solid memory space. That phone pushes well and works, and whether it has a headphone jack and whether it runs certain games without crashing, it doesn't matter whether it has or doesn't have a headphone jack, there are always headphones with a type C input... For certain games, you buy the S series and you don't complicate it for $200, you can't expect it to applaud you and the battery is saved just like the phone."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Has been a great work phone, I have an IPhone 15 pro Max for my daily personal but this Samsung was brought as mine for management and so far it's been great for what it is"
SuIl1KRWhSc,for what its worth at least Samsung is stepping up their official software support game.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Looking at benchmark results, it can be summed up as ""What if the S9 had a battery?"""
SuIl1KRWhSc,"i have a 52s 5g and an A15  4g....so far A15 runs as smoothly as my 52, if you dont overload it with apps, its running fast and smooth as hell..also the 128 gb storage and the 4 gb ram is tremendous for a cheap phone like that- but what is a 10/10 is its battery!!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Hooray...Snow This Time... Absolutely Splendid...
SuIl1KRWhSc,My favorite YouTuber by far I watch all of your reviews
SuIl1KRWhSc,For a13 the a15 a real succesor finally
SuIl1KRWhSc,"3:53 PDAF& OIS, it only has AF, and it also gets 4 years os updates it says on samsung"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Hello Will, please help me.  I want to know where I can buy the same earrings you have in this videos...? 🙏🏼"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got this phone to replace my a03..a15 4g is a good phone after a month of usage. Videos, camera, social media, casual gaming are execellent no lag no heating battery is good. I love samsung compare to chinese phones."
SuIl1KRWhSc,It's funny how I watch more reviews from this guy than any other tech YouTuber and I still don't know his full name.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"You only get a charging cable in the box now, not adapter, headphones etc? Haven't bought a new phone since S6."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn. Surveillance quality videos.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I love that it has a decently modern 6nm chipset, great for battery life, but those AMOLED screens are more of a liability, shadows and more sensitive to impacts. OIS would be nice. The SD card and headphone jack are great."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Most people don't use half the shit on their phone. Buying a $2000 phone is ridiculous. This is just fine.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from my brand new A15 im so loving it❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,What is the pulse width modulation level at different brightness levels?  Thank you in advance.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Bought Today, Great Phone🎉"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Great review of Samsung a24, i mean a15"
SuIl1KRWhSc,As a lite user this phone is enough for me
SuIl1KRWhSc,What is memory type?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I want to know if Samsung  A15 will also have Samsung Cloud Back up, like we have on the Flagship Phones"
SuIl1KRWhSc,3:57 There's no OIS.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn that blue looks hot
SuIl1KRWhSc,"In your opinion, will this phone be a good alternative for a travel phone? One that mostly is used to take pics, Google Maps, Translate, and to communicate through WhatsApp,Facebook, and use UBER or other transport. apps? I got my normal cell phone  but need a second one just for travel and one that be inexpensive but good enough to manage esim,pics and what we mostly use overseas while traveling."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Headphone jack and microSD in 2024? On a $120 phone? What a steal!
SuIl1KRWhSc,just bought this right now from amazon canada for 170$ it'll be here in a few days ill let you know how it went.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"The Amoled is a big win on these phones.
Only if the A5x would get S-series features too"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Does this phone has call recording option without informing the call reciever?
SuIl1KRWhSc,The bezels are iconic 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,For a budget phone it looks hella good.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Just upgraded from the A13 and the difference in quality is crazy
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just got the 5G version. Replacing my Bricked A51. Overall it's a nice phone.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Are you able to hide the notch like the old times?
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just purchase this phone on Amazon for $130.00 for a friend in the Caribbean..i think she would be happy with my choice..all she need it to make calls and text and this phone is plenty for her needs..good review by the way
SuIl1KRWhSc,Can you include walking video test in the future?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching this in my Samsung A70 from 2019😂
SuIl1KRWhSc,Nice review
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Using ot right now, its a very good phone for its phone extraordinary value!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Bro you have mixed some features of 4G and 5G versions.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Can this phone be used in the USA with a SIM from a network outside the USA?
My phone that I was using for my congo sim broke down. and I wanted to buy this Samsung A15 for my congo sim. will it work? note that I am in the USA. THANKS"
SuIl1KRWhSc,This is similar to a24 and that is amazing 👏 😮
SuIl1KRWhSc,A15 5g is really awesome❤❤.no complaints 🎉🎉
SuIl1KRWhSc,"no deep camera/video test, i just finished with this channel"
SuIl1KRWhSc,I am dying  to know if this is the last samsung phone ever not to have 5g network... what do you think?.. please answer..
SuIl1KRWhSc,It has the exact same external build as the A55?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Good solid phone. Got one for less then $150 with case and it’s worth it.
SuIl1KRWhSc,This is my new phone because i lost my old phone and it's good
SuIl1KRWhSc,What country is gsmarena in? Some with kyrillic letters.
SuIl1KRWhSc,This Samsung a15 have otg and possible to connect lavallier wireless microphone  for vlogging
SuIl1KRWhSc,is this ok for riders/drivers who uses waze or delivery/ride-hauling apps?
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this phone. 6gb ram really makes butter smooth.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from A15❤❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Did not mention that this phone does not have timelapse camera option. Purely softwarily limited, probably so people would buy expensive phone instead."
SuIl1KRWhSc,is this ufs?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Is ingress protection like gorilla glass? Does it have gorilla glass protection?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"How can a 200€ phone have more functions than a 1500€ one? Phone jack? Expandable storage? FM radio? Sure S24 has some stuff thats more advanced, but you never use it...  the really usable stuff is missing..."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"The general performance is not the best, but what a beauty the Amoled screen and many future updates are. However, we hope that the software is optimized properly, otherwise it will become unusable"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Memory card support up to ???
SuIl1KRWhSc,Can it still work until 6-8 years?
SuIl1KRWhSc,is it eMMC ?
SuIl1KRWhSc,The new battery life score is confusing to look at unless you compare it to phones that has both the old and the new scores on their site.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"a24 or a15 
please advise which one is better"
SuIl1KRWhSc,What about the front camera?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Are they compatible with apps update? For example, would Facebook stop working on this phone if the app had an upgrade?"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Please make a full review of the s24 plus I'm thinking of Pre order
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching  it on my a35 5g  looking  good
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks Samsung top notch until 2030
SuIl1KRWhSc,Is it emmc5.1 or ufs 2
SuIl1KRWhSc,Which phone will be a step up from this one? Without upping price very much. I need better camera than the A15.
SuIl1KRWhSc,I got the 5g version today!!
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Looking for a suggestion from anyone knowledgeable:

I would like to buy this version of a15 4g with 8gb ram, I found a deal for 150€, I'm concerned about not having 5G connection in the future.

Should I not care about it and just buy it or wait for a16 instead?"
SuIl1KRWhSc,please what do you mean with no ingress protection???
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this and don't mind it
SuIl1KRWhSc,"""These low end budget devices keep getting better and better"". I love how they find a way to praise and demean simultaneously in the same sentence.🤣"
SuIl1KRWhSc,I haven't seen an Angie video in forever 😢 Is she still at GSMArena?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Does it run tiktok amoothly without crashing thata all i really want to know
SuIl1KRWhSc,What its IP rating?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Price please
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Bought Samsung A15 and I must say that for the price, its worth it. I bought 8/256 variant, camera performs well in good lightening conditions especially the front one and back camera 50mp does a good job even with a flashlight only. Charging speed has improved and battery works really well, I was expecting 4G+ support on this one but unfortunately it doesn't support that, guess that's the only con. The rest, it will work well for couple of years with 4 major updates and 5 years patches. ;)"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Cellphone is supposed to be a Telephone First. I bought the Samsung A15 after watching this review. and found after getting my 5G Sim card, the ear speaker sound quality very Tinny. I wished the reviewer had tested the A15 for ear speaker sound quality. I replaced my, lower priced,  Moto G pure worked great as a phone! The A15 demo phone did not have a Sim card so i could not hear the ear speaker quality. I guess I have to live with it.."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thank you 🙏
SuIl1KRWhSc,A52 or A15 4G? I need help🤧
SuIl1KRWhSc,Waooo... Going to get it immediately
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I bought this phone as 2nd phone. It's good enough for basic usage. Good battery life, amoled screen, casual gaming. It also has smartview for streaming your phone to TV. But, the camera quality is average."
bCSiFL3PdsA,What are your thoughts on my take?
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Nothing can beat their software and camera for this price though
A15 is currently the best and most value for money budget phone for it's price"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I will never use a Tecno or infinix ever again in my life, it's all hype, their phones are always buggy"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"whatever the situation. Samsung is what I'll always choose. Whichever variety you purchase, you will find excellent use for it. 🎉"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Don't compare tecno to the legendary samsung
bCSiFL3PdsA,"The fact that it a tecno phone,  it kind of ""devalue"" the phone ...
People will still buy the samsung bcos of brand name"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"It's not just specs
if people could pay an extra $20-$40 for 5years of software update on a tecno or infinix they probably would
samsung also has better build quality, better software, better experience and confidence in the brand name
the resale value of a samsung is better too."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Not bad fr, I'd pick Samsung over Tecno"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I will still buy Samsung because of 4 Year software 
up to Android 18 and people say bad Tecno software 😐"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Software tramples Hardware all the time. With a samsung phone like a15 you will get until android 18. With tecno you will stay on android 13 for as long as you have the phone meaning you will be outdated for a while. A tecno can come with a curved screen, 65W charging speed but I'd still take a Samsung with a u-shaped notch and a 25w charger. I do not hate tecno or infinix or other specs-filled devices competing with samsung but I have never heard someone say that it was the best phone they have ever had."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Why avoid Samsung Galaxy A25 and Galaxy A15? Most likely because these two models have 
3.5 mm headphone jacks and the majority of Samsung phones now are upper end ones with no 3.5 mm headphone jacks. I was told by some sales people that  Samsung is pushing mostly expensive phones without 3.5 mm headphone jacks so you can buy their bluetooth ear buds etc., some very expensive. I have three Samsung phones A14 4g and A15 5g and I absolutely love them!!  I get to use my regular headsets- no thanks to earbuds as well."
bCSiFL3PdsA,They don't provide the extras to reduce the amount of junk filling our landfills. Most people already have one or more chargers and better headphones than the ones often supplied. I'm happy to just get the phone and cable to help reduce pollution.
bCSiFL3PdsA,My opinion I would still pick samsung tecno software is not good
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Hello Oscar, i think you're actually speaking my mind...i'm about to purchase this phone but that notch is so annoying....I'm still contemplating getting it..i wouldn't know something so insignificant in my opinion is really annoying me😂😂"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Im using Samsung A15, and it's good for me, samsung will always be the best android phone"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung made thick frames and notch on purpose so that the customers consider more expensive models
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Samsung really like to overprice the mid range phones, they need to do better"
bCSiFL3PdsA,But still samsung can definitely do better at least give us back a charger with every phone instead they choose to leave it out of the box.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"For the price , the A25 is a decent smartphone,  much better than a13 phone"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Remember the times when all samsung deviced got free cool in-ear headphones with the phone?
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Samsung software is stable and reliable. Also, updates are guaranteed for at least 3 years for budget phones. Tecno and the rest have crappy software, and support is very limited. Not to mention the annoying pop-ups and advertisements."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I have been using Huawei phones all my life, I recently purchased my first Samsung phone and I'm not disappointed at all although I would have preferred to continue the streak of Huawei phones"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I am sucker for amoled screens, my phone broke and i want to get a repalcement ( i dont mind used even). In your opinion, whats the best phone to get till i save up for my baby, the pixel 8 pro?"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"First of all you're talking too fast 2nd of all you didn't tell us what is bad about the phones I think they are ok you didn't point out anything that's really bad about them for the price you pay.
The A 15 is a cracking phone for its money. I don't understand your gripe"
bCSiFL3PdsA,A15 is de'baddest. Did you say Tecno? I upgraded from Infinix to Samsung.
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung have good software better than tecno.Warranty is longer as well.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I was choosing between samsung Galaxy a15 8/256 and realme 11 8/256. Taking into account the price of the samsung charging unit and the case, the price was the same. As a result, I liked Samsung more and bought it yesterday"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Hwve my sight set on the A54 5G i hate tear drop notch, plus the new phones are just too big"
bCSiFL3PdsA,How would you compare the A15 vs S21
bCSiFL3PdsA,It is the higher tier phone from last year at a lower price with minimal diferences.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"As someone who owns an A24, I'm not compelled to get any of these phones."
bCSiFL3PdsA,i cant buy any of those because of that front camera design am fed up of seeing it
bCSiFL3PdsA,man this mobile will be upgradable to android 18. that a reason to buy
bCSiFL3PdsA,I like that wallpaper how can get it?
bCSiFL3PdsA,I was expecting something bad but those are things we can ignore but without a doubt I'm still sticking with Samsung
bCSiFL3PdsA,Even if the phone comes without the box  i will still buy it
bCSiFL3PdsA,Don't even think about using an external mic with an a15
bCSiFL3PdsA,But dude which  one  🤔 to pick among  them
bCSiFL3PdsA,Recently I purchased Galaxy A25 but front camera very very poor    I cantact Samsung care they are not helping  please don't buy
bCSiFL3PdsA,It's the choice not that they are better than techno infinix and oppo. In fact itel is doing better.
bCSiFL3PdsA,Please can u do reviews on LG phones.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"A15 vs 15 Pro Max: the Samsung any time, at 1/10th the price, it is astonishing and offering stuff Apple can't fix. My top reasons for the A15: Tweakability, Less forced apps (you can bypass all Google crapware if you like, on Apple you sink in the stink of the iOS bundled app swamp), Firefox with Adblocker (hello Apple!), USB mass storage/fast charging, 3,5mm jack, SD card slot, fingerprint scanner in the on-switch and it feels as premium as the 15 Pro Max. The only dodgy thing is it tried to install Temu, Tik Tok and Candy Crush.... Guess they need some junk firms to pay the bill at Samsung. It was easily deleted though."
bCSiFL3PdsA,I have a question for u guys! Should i get the Samsung a15 or the Redmi Xiaomi 13c?
bCSiFL3PdsA,I wouldn't never pick tecno or infinix phone over Samsung. Their phones are full of bloatware the magically appears even though you didn't download them.
bCSiFL3PdsA,What will happen if I buy Samsung a15 😢
bCSiFL3PdsA,I dont get this cancel u cnt be doing a review to make people buy and wen u dnt get likes u say dnt buy
bCSiFL3PdsA,I love the teardrop notch.
bCSiFL3PdsA,I can pic Samsung because of up to 4 -5  of years software
bCSiFL3PdsA,Still a budget phone bro what more do u want
bCSiFL3PdsA,SO YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE A HOLE IN YOUR SCREEN??? Please give me a notch every time. I would prefer you sacrifice 2 millimeters of screen than to put a hole in the middle of one. That is the equivalent of selling pants with holes already added.
bCSiFL3PdsA,Also no protection of any kind to the screen.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"It's clear that Samsung doesn't give a damn about consumers in general and no charger in box tells alot. 
Even the Cheapest Samsung A05 doesn't have charger in the box 😂
I would also like to mention that I can no longer stand the ugly water drop notch and big bezels. 🤬"
bCSiFL3PdsA,I have the a15 switching from the iPhone 8 plus and I like it a lot more it's better but yes I am comparing December 2023 phone to July 2017 phone lol
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Samsung is the best.
Forget Tecno"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Looks like Samsung thinks that they're the IPhones of the Android world! 
They should simply discontinue making anything other than flag ship phones. 
I'd rather go for other brands that are already taking over their market worldwide."
bCSiFL3PdsA,If Tecno will keep their software up to date and good UI then I can consider
bCSiFL3PdsA,with samsung I feel its just the software that would make someone want to get this phone
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Every other samsung phone sucks for this simple reason: no Headphone jack, like wtf? trash!"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Which phone do you recommend over A34/A25
bCSiFL3PdsA,why weak net work in poor internat net work
bCSiFL3PdsA,Best is a10e or a14
bCSiFL3PdsA,You need Jesus my guy not a Tecno
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Thick bezels dont bother me,althoug they could include a loader and mayby a backcase like asus did"
bCSiFL3PdsA,The A34 its way better than these two for the same price  as the A25 instead of the jack
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Awesome video, Tecno and infinix are really improving in what they offer but then. Yeah, brand name is at work when it comes to Samsung and this there A series phones. Unless its a hardcore Samsung fan. You get more from Tecno, infinix, redmi compared to Galaxy A10s and A20s"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Solid points, but samsung has a better and  more reliable software imo."
bCSiFL3PdsA,I just got a Samsung a15 today
bCSiFL3PdsA,Ill choose this phone compared to your techno phones.this phone will lasts for many years compared to techno phones and thats real value for money.the only Downside of this phone is that it has no charger in the box.
bCSiFL3PdsA,My opinion is he's not wrong but you should be able to check a box or something if you want the free case and you want to 25 watt fast charger you should have two boxes to check I understand some people don't need the charger other people want and need one especially if it's their first smartphone for their kid
bCSiFL3PdsA,No headphone 🎧 no charger than there is no battery 🔋 in the phone 📱 and no phone in the box 😅 only name on the box 😅
bCSiFL3PdsA,"5 days ago, you gave 5 reasons you love the Samsung A25 🤔"
bCSiFL3PdsA,I don know why people compare Samusng budget with tecno ...we still happy with samsung os .... Tecno is tecno 😂
bCSiFL3PdsA,I alwwys change my samsung phone every 3 year on my birthday. March 6... now im having a second thought on this A15.... and i dnt really F with techno tho 😢chai
bCSiFL3PdsA,Very true n sincere bro.!
bCSiFL3PdsA,"No charger and ""U"" shaped camera so i won't be buying it."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"At the price they're selling, no complaints for me. You get what you pay for. Want better phones with more features? Be prepared to pay for them.
Btw, I'm only talking about the SAMSUNG brand."
bCSiFL3PdsA,Of course after buying it everyone says its not good like always
bCSiFL3PdsA,these are good budget phones but I need some kind of water protection
bCSiFL3PdsA,I can't say no to Samsung A15 LTE now it's selling below $100 in my country. 😊
bCSiFL3PdsA,Cuidate mi hermano. Thank you for a great review.
bCSiFL3PdsA,I don't know why people hate dewdrop hole. I prefer it to punch hole and I hope Samsung budget phones keeps it
bCSiFL3PdsA,5 month's ago you said you loved it and now you're saying to avoid it?😂
bCSiFL3PdsA,"A bit disappointed too especially with you, i bought this phone Samsung A25 after watching your review, shortly after  getting hold of it, its reality booms, you said the battery last you a day with 20% remain, my battery cannot even stand complete 6hrs with average usage, not to talk of its hotzone , to be sincere Samsung is just ripping us off with these their A series, pls go for S - series if you must buy Samsung phone this season"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Abit disappointing?... more like highly dissatisfied
bCSiFL3PdsA,"This guy's BS, he has another video called ""5 reasons to love the A25""! He's just making videos to get views not help people"
bCSiFL3PdsA,SAMSUNG still for the Win!
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Software software software longevity, no buying 2 year trash"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Idk about A25
But A15 Is great device for me🔥"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung  was lazy by adding bad parts in phone
bCSiFL3PdsA,I'm watching this on an A25😂
bCSiFL3PdsA,Both phones will freeze  on u
bCSiFL3PdsA,And with Base
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung remains the best
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Seriously, these so-called reviewers can front t a nonexistent agenda.
Always blowing hot air. Leave consumers to their preferences.

It's is these same flaws that have you to get a YouTube job. Without them what would you rant about?"
bCSiFL3PdsA,This video was just 🥰
bCSiFL3PdsA,An a14 is kinda better
bCSiFL3PdsA,"First of all Samsung Produces different series every year (A series,S series, (I don't know if they still making M series) so they need to make the phones different so if you want better experience buy the company flagship product (S series). And about the chargers and everything. Everyone has chargers already why need more?? And they said they do that now for the sake of environment. You get what you pay for low budget phone don't expect much."
bCSiFL3PdsA,So you hate my phone
bCSiFL3PdsA,I prefer Samsung but my A 15 has been one picky bi**h. Much better since 6.1. 10 × better than brand new. 🎉🎉
bCSiFL3PdsA,They messed up
32EeGI4hyTc,Do you think the A15 is a worthy upgrade?
32EeGI4hyTc,"the A15 is the first A1x device to be getting 4os updates with an additional year of security patches, so 5 years of software support!"
32EeGI4hyTc,"the fact that nowadays you can get an amoled display with 90hz in a low-end phone without sacrificing too much the camera and the hardware departments, is crazy to me"
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing❤
The A15 is the pick for me💯"
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing - Thank you for the clear and quick review. DEFINITELY made my decision easier. I NEVER comment on videos but I've never found a review as ""layman friendly"""
32EeGI4hyTc,"Guys trust me it is worth it i bought the a14 when it was released it did have some small lags, not very smooth scrolling and display,very slow charging. 
I bought the a15 two days ago i noticed a very big difference animation, scrolling, fast charging, better colors but dont buy the 4gb ram version buy 6 or 8"

32EeGI4hyTc,can you do this?samsung a15 vs  s 10 ?
32EeGI4hyTc,how much better is a14 batt life? minutes? hours?
32EeGI4hyTc,Amazing 👏🏻
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing GG

Cuidate"
32EeGI4hyTc,Which is fater between the A15 & the A15 5G
32EeGI4hyTc,a15 or redmi note 12 ?
32EeGI4hyTc,"I don’t know if one ui 6 will have a core version

Maybe they will scrap the core version"
32EeGI4hyTc,the video sound of the A14 is notorious of being bad... is the A15 any better.
32EeGI4hyTc,The galaxy a05s has a snapdragon 680 and this device the helio g99. Who is better for you?
32EeGI4hyTc,Thanks to update
32EeGI4hyTc,I'm keeping my Samsung A24
32EeGI4hyTc,This is amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,Please do a computer between Samsung A15 and a05s😂
32EeGI4hyTc,I'm definitely going to upgrade form the 14 to 15
32EeGI4hyTc,amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,Amazing
32EeGI4hyTc,Awesome
32EeGI4hyTc,The Samsung Galaxy A1x series is very good this year...
32EeGI4hyTc,Yes it is worth an upgrade
32EeGI4hyTc,I have the A14 it an its really nice i had a A04 before
32EeGI4hyTc,Although the A15 has an amoled display it's resolution and pixel density is inferior to the A 14. Having looked at both side by side the 14 has a sharper display so to my eyes the amoled display is pointless !
32EeGI4hyTc,Ery helpful. Rh !
32EeGI4hyTc,are these 5g or 4g?
32EeGI4hyTc,"The display is a big upgrade. However, the entire phone is a bit smaller, and though there is a new processor, performance will still be virtually the same. If they continue this AMOLED trend, then I will really consider the A16.

-An A14 user"
32EeGI4hyTc,How much A15 ????
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 is now A24 the specs are identically .😂
32EeGI4hyTc,Amaxing
32EeGI4hyTc,Resolution is fhd+ not hd+
32EeGI4hyTc,Am I the only one who prefers the Infinity V on the A14?
32EeGI4hyTc,But how much is it in retail price
32EeGI4hyTc,"Amazing.

A15 is definitely better."
32EeGI4hyTc,"I prefer narrower a14 display, ascpect ratio, a15 good spec, but they shouldnt had changed aspect ratio"
32EeGI4hyTc,i have galaxy a14.... it does have the 90hz refresh rate
32EeGI4hyTc,"The A14 was 60 bucks QVC Tracphone ,I now Have 3,400 Minutes Phone and5000 texts  ,Buy New every Year and Transfer minutes, No monthly.."
32EeGI4hyTc,Lover your videos Oscar 👏
32EeGI4hyTc,But AMOLEDs are susceptible to green lines and led burns.
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 ❤
32EeGI4hyTc,"Damm bro tysm!
I wanted to buy a new phone and i was thinking about the A14 or the A15.
And now I know which one to buy thanks to you! :D

P.S. W for doing the camera test. It helped me A LOT!!!"
32EeGI4hyTc,Can I get a phone😢?....I know u have more than enough for urself
32EeGI4hyTc,Actually the A15 is FHD+ not HD+
32EeGI4hyTc,Am going to change my phone now
32EeGI4hyTc,"But a14 😂 is good yoh..its just fighting with processing power for pictures, but if you check the videos, it's leading my guy.."
32EeGI4hyTc,You see that notch they need to drop it I literally got an Infinix because of that notch is ugly. They should introduce punch hole to the low budget a series
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 is more better
32EeGI4hyTc,A14 5g is $80 for me
32EeGI4hyTc,Yap all things being equal
32EeGI4hyTc,this is so hard?
32EeGI4hyTc,I like you 😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
32EeGI4hyTc,Me watching this video on my redmi 13c no overheating or lagging redmi do all
32EeGI4hyTc,the a15 looks okay from the front and the a14 is just ugly as hell
32EeGI4hyTc,Got tthe a14 for 75 out the door
32EeGI4hyTc,A15 only work with one sim
32EeGI4hyTc,😅 Amazing
VDwxEagh188,"I bought this phone Samsung A15  about a month ago'  and i have to say this is a great phone, its fast has a lot or storage and a great battery, like the screen very nice and has  great sound, love the ( yellow color)  two people in my family and my friend bought this same phone this week and they really like it,  We all enjoy this phone glad we purchased it."
VDwxEagh188,"I just purchased my Samsung A15 a month ago, trying to get adjusted to it, coming from a iPhone.  I like it, love the features. very nice"
VDwxEagh188,I can't wait a little bit longer to have this galaxy A15 5g..i really admire it
VDwxEagh188,"Still here Salute. I bought this phone today at BB for memorial day and after unboxing I really like this phone. Looks solid, nice phone and love the fact that today when plugged in for first time to charge I love the fact that it shows battery life and charging time stays on."
VDwxEagh188,"That's what I'm going to buy. I don't like poco and redmi, my friend's poco x6 pro was thrown away because it turned off suddenly while playing games. Samsung legit is still good."
VDwxEagh188,Just letting people know you can boost the volume without using a sound booster. It called media volume limit. I will put up a description of f how to do it if people are unable to do it. 🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,"As phones keep getting expensive, I ended up getting this phone recently and loving it so far. The only downside was that it does not have always on display but other than that happy with my purchase."
VDwxEagh188,I ordered the a15 5g from Straight talk last week. Picked up one for me and one for my brother for $87 for 2 since it was free with the $45 monthly plan. At that price I figured it would totally be worth it. Waiting on it to arrive on Thursday.
VDwxEagh188,I ordered mone today and I know im going to love it.
VDwxEagh188,Awesome review. I got this phone. I love it
VDwxEagh188,"Loving my a15 5g. Seems to be a little bit slower than my a14 5g,but not a big deal considering all that is on this phone. The size and design fits my hand so much better than the a14 5g."
VDwxEagh188,This device is kinda like the J7 or J7 prime on steroids!!!!!
VDwxEagh188,im still here :) i have this phone liking it so far x
VDwxEagh188,"I""m still here when come to samsung phones i like is the software & security updates i do own one of this phone myself 😍✌️"
VDwxEagh188,Excellent comprehensive review.
VDwxEagh188,"I love this phone as I bought it thinking it had three Card Slots like the Samsung A10 and Samsung A05S. But unfortunately not. So I have bought the Samsung AO5s and have decided to use the Samsung A15 4G as a Street Photography editing tablet with a Samsung  512 GB SD Card inside.

I must admit both the Samsung A24 4G  and Samsung A25 5G 256GB are also on my to purchase list.
The Samsung A15 5G with 256GB is also on my list and perhaps the Samsung A16 5G depending on what they so with it"
VDwxEagh188,Ur so lucky to have all those apps. Mine can’t handle all that
VDwxEagh188,This phone is great ! I bought it in September 2024 and I can say that I like it! I really like your video posts and they helped me a lot to optimize this phone. Thank you very much!
VDwxEagh188,"I swapped my old Iphone 7 plus to this. I only add Php3000. 
I love it."
VDwxEagh188,"3.5 mm Jack,Cheap,Great battery,Oled Display..Sir,take my money and give me that phone"
VDwxEagh188,"I agree with below comments - very happy with this phone. Admittedly I only do very basic stuff, but it works fast, effectively. I was lucky - got mine for £123.99 and a friend set it up for me. I dont use ""stuff"", so out of that window. But its works fine. Oddly I get no signal in a local supermarket where everyone else does... must be a frequency thing... other than that - fine."
VDwxEagh188,"i bought this coz of your reviews. i use this as a secondary phone to my Galaxy A34 5G.

yes i also have the February security patch. i got the 8/256GB variant. it has only the hybrid SIM tray in our country. and so far i love using my A15 5G. it has no problems. everything is very good for the price. i have no problems with it."
VDwxEagh188,I bought mine 6 months ago and now the screen has frozen and I can't use it?
VDwxEagh188,"I recently saw one of these Samsung A15 5g phones in my local Walmart and I was impressed with this screen quality and the build too.  How would you say performance in regards to multitasking holds up?  Also, do those matte screen protectors make a difference with the phone out in direct sunlight?  I enjoy content on the budget devices to see what they’re capable of, keep up the great content!"
VDwxEagh188,"Hey what stand are you using to film the phone? It looks cool! Send a link please, super interested!"
VDwxEagh188,"Is fast and also  use it as a music bank,and photo bank."
VDwxEagh188,Great review bro got a question for you does this have Smart view for screen mirroring to the tv 🤔
VDwxEagh188,"You just earned yourself a new subscriber.

I love your honest review.

Can this Phone do Front and Back video recording at same time?"
VDwxEagh188,"planning to have a15 this month, is it dual sim?"
VDwxEagh188,I’m still here
VDwxEagh188,Its a great phone
VDwxEagh188,"Thanks for a great comprehensive review! Believe it or not I bought the Samsung J320A back when it came out, I believe that was 2016 and that is the phone I am still using, I have a mini sd card in it so glad to know I can use that card to access my data from the A15. I need to update because I'm getting messages from programs that I use that my phone can't update to their latest version. The A15 is the one I am considering. I'm wondering if I take my sim card from my J320A and put it in the A15 will I then have the same phone number and plan that I have with my A320J? I have ATT prepaid."
VDwxEagh188,I purchased 2 …. I from Tracfone  for about $130.00 and one from Ebay for $65.00 both new in box . They replace the  two A 12 and are capable of of running some apps  the A12 will not ( Samsung Smartthings for one ) one phone will be getting the 256 gb SD card from the old phone for pictures videos and music it will be used as external storage .
VDwxEagh188,I have the phone and seems like it's a decent phone. On Wifi it's like smooth butter but on the 5g network data it's so damn slow and just turns and buffers most of the damn time! I called boostmobile and i seem to have good coverage but this phone is so slow. And unfortunately it's impossible to be on Wifi all the time. I really wanna throw the phone out the window!!! 🙄😬
VDwxEagh188,"Do you have the 4G version to compare with? And do these thing reload backgrounded apps a lot?
My lg with 8gb started refreshing apps sent to background as the updates came along. It sucks."
VDwxEagh188,Planned obsolescence just like that every other phone without a user replaceable battery.
VDwxEagh188,"I am buy this phone tomorrow, if they use the virtual ram for background processes and the physical ram is not being used for that then its already good. N1 killer on smartphones are the background apps running. If you have a LCD screen like me and going to super Amoled, then the screen is going to be God tier and it has a good camera for me coming from a Nokia G20. The Nokia G20 that I have has sometimes artifacting in the instagram and youtube shorts, can't watch 720p 60fps video without lagging and on some objects the camera does not focus. Nokia G20 is not a bad phone, it's software is not good. I don't blame the hardware, but I always blame the software."
VDwxEagh188,Is this phone better than the A52s 5G?
VDwxEagh188,i have a question i bought this phone everything is good but i am facing issue with its proximity sensor its screen do not switch off when i take the phone to ear and also when i play the voice note in whatsapp its screen don't switch off and also voice comes from loud speaker when i take to my ear
VDwxEagh188,Im using it as my daily phone its great
VDwxEagh188,Could you please name the case you are using again I'm unable to find it. I need that case. 😁🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,we got 8/256 variant here....
VDwxEagh188,"Are sure that ram plus boost it to 8gb? , i only see 4"
VDwxEagh188,"From 150$ to 200$ There are other better phone like cmf, m35, z9s. I this like z9s for dyanamic range in images. Cmf for like design. M35 is overall best in price segment but performance could have been better.
Suggest me some if you know better mobile."
VDwxEagh188,on one ui 6.0 not 6.1 will come soon tho
VDwxEagh188,My only concern with this phone is camera quality... How good is the camera guys? Especially compared to the Redmi Note 13
VDwxEagh188,A15 is a AMOLED  bro not lcd
VDwxEagh188,"Sir ,how is the call quality.Is the voice clear ?"
VDwxEagh188,But i am facing problem like its draining 2x faster than normal playing of 5 to 6 min of utube consumes exactly 1% every time any solution for this...?
VDwxEagh188,How strong its build in Bluetooth?
VDwxEagh188,I'm overseas is it okay  for the Caribbean 🇭🇹 Halla 256 GB
VDwxEagh188,The RAM you showed is just like the A14.2gig RAM expandable to 4gig
VDwxEagh188,Have the blue
VDwxEagh188,A15 or a34 who worth to buy??
VDwxEagh188,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
VDwxEagh188,This phone takes good pictures in the back but the selfie camera is not as crispy and detailed like the back camera is doing I just got this phone 3 days ago and I like everything about it except the selfie camera I have a Huawei p30 lite and the selfie camera is 34mp and takes really good detail pictures in the back and front and I paid 200 something for that one and I paid 200 something for the new galaxy a15 but that selfie camera is not it
VDwxEagh188,💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
VDwxEagh188,"sir, you accidentally leaked your phone number!"
VDwxEagh188,wow
VDwxEagh188,Buy OnePlus 12 awesome phone
VDwxEagh188,Boss
VDwxEagh188,"The mediatek helio g99 is ridiculously slow and  freezes compared to snapdragon both with 4gb.

Snapdragon is faster"

iso6qgCo6vI,"I'm a 73 yr old woman getting my first smartphone.  I've been feeling a little fearful and overwhelmed with the technology.  I wouldn't even know how to turn it on.  Thank you so much for a clear, easily understandable training.  I'm feeling a lot more confident about the phone arriving on Monday."
iso6qgCo6vI,Outstanding!  A non-tech-savvy family member just bought one of these phones and I have had my hands full trying to explain to him how his phone works.  This video is a perfect introduction to the A15.
iso6qgCo6vI,You have changed my world with this video! Thank you for clear and understandable instructions for us older folks
iso6qgCo6vI,"FINALLY!!!!!  GREAT VIDEO FOR 80 YEAR OLD LADIES!!!!  NICE AND PATIENT, NO ""SALAD LANGUAGE"".  SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS!  THIS NEW PHONE HAS BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS.  THANKS SOOOOOO MUCH.  I'LL BE LOOKING FOR MORE FROM YOU."
iso6qgCo6vI,I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy. I am a senior citizen and this video was very informative. I thank you very much. I will be watching more of your videos.
iso6qgCo6vI,"Very nice presentation for beginners and old farts. I'm an old fart, and these phones scare me. You made me so comfortable with my new A15 . I had an older version Galaxy J7, and only did the basics with it. I feel more at home when I pick it up now. your video gets 2 thumbs up for clarity and complete explanations for what you covered. Thanks"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks Wayne!  Just got this phone today - an upgrade from my Samsung A11.  It's pretty similar but your tutorial is appreciated!  Oh, I am really looking forward to you explaining how to put in a 4 digit security password!  Great stuff, Wayne!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"When it comes to cell phones, you can't find anyone more green at it.  I literally knew zip; however, your style in explaining is excellent, easy to understand, and done at a pace where learning takes place more easily.  Many kudos to you.  I look forward to the next video.  Now I feel much less frustrated in that I'm starting to get it!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for making this phone easy to understand, Just changed from years of Flip phones, have been afraid to make the change, Great Video."
iso6qgCo6vI,At last-a great presentation for us older folks without silly music and clear speech.Well done!(England).
iso6qgCo6vI,I LOVED ALL OF IT. I JUST GOT THE PHONE HAVING AN LG IN THE PAST FROM 9 YEARS AGO. YOU ARE AWESOME. I COULD NOT HAVE GOT THIS INFO IN THE STORE
iso6qgCo6vI,I have been waiting for such type of information for a long time . I am satisfied .Very kind of you. Thanks.
iso6qgCo6vI,"I have never had a Samsung, my mom just bought this phone and I sent her this tutorial and she can actually follow it!! You really out here helping people so much. And not being condescending or making people feel stupid. Thank You😃"
iso6qgCo6vI,"After updating from a phone that was 7-9 years old, this was very valuable. Well presented !"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you for explaining this well.  Some of it is over my head, and I can only do a little at a time.  I have had this phone for about a month and was so happy when I found your video!  There’s so much I don’t know how to do.  I’ll keep listening.  I may have to play this a few times,  but am grateful you made it.  ❤

My gripe is the lady at the T-Mobile store was mean.  She made me cry and feel so stupid I just got my stuff and left.  T-Mobile, however, responded quickly and so caringly — they are not going to bill me till December because the woman was so mean, and they said they don’t tolerate that — especially being so nasty to a 25-year customer.  Good service from T-Mobile!"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you very much indeed for such a great presentation.   Very easy to understand and I can now do everything on my new A15  (at the age of 81 years!)     You are a brilliant tutor!   From Herefordshire, England."

iso6qgCo6vI,"This video for the phone I just bought was a life saver!  Am elderly and very tech challenged!  Tried the first video by someone else and immediately turned it off.  Then I found your video.  Easy to understand and pause, as needed.  I highly recommend this video.  Liked and subscribed.  Going to watch all of your videos that pertain to my Samsung Galaxy 15.  Was seriously about to turn in and pay the restocking fee to get rid of the phone.  With your help, am going to be able to maneuver the phone and do everything I need to do!  Thank you so much!"

iso6qgCo6vI,"How to make a call at 24:02!  So many of these ""basic"" videos assume we already know that.  I'm 78  and this is my first cell phone of any kind.  As AT&T cut my landline off I was home alone with no way to call 911 in an emergency.  Now I can!  Thank you!"

iso6qgCo6vI,Your video was helpful explainng about all the features on Samsung A15 phone. ❤❤❤❤❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Loved the  presentation.  It was easy to follow along.  Glad I came upon this tutorial.
iso6qgCo6vI,This was a very helpful video.  Thank you!  Shortcuts on how to navigate were awesome.  I used to hunt for settings!!
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you so very much for this great video!!! I just bought this phone today and by watching you run through so many functions, I feel like I might just know what I am doing with it, even after just a few hours of owning it. YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!!"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you.  I was going back to the shop tomorrow!!!! X
iso6qgCo6vI,I like the way you teach and model step by step the navigation process on the phone. It was very helpful so that I can show it to my beginning cell buyers and they need to know basically the fundamentals and navigation of using a cell phone.
iso6qgCo6vI,great video can't figure out how to set up voicemail
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you for helping me figure this phone out. You are a jewel.❤
iso6qgCo6vI,"At last,A very big Thank you😊"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks so  much for this video.. I have a Samsung Galaxy A15 5G coming to me in the next week or so, so it was great to view your video and prepare myself how to use it etc thanks to your video...thanks again"
iso6qgCo6vI,This was SO helpful! There were so many features I didn't know I had. Thank you!
iso6qgCo6vI,"Very good information for us older generation. You are an excellent teacher, just upgraded to this phone, all sections were good, especially liked how you explained setting up different email accounts. I will try that."
iso6qgCo6vI,"Quick question.... Having a heck of a time Setting up voicemail on this, sorry new phone.... Great video and break down, appreciate your time"

iso6qgCo6vI,Very helpful❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you so very much for this video very informative!!!
iso6qgCo6vI,"2 issues I have with my A15.
the first is the size of the bubble when texting.  I've read that there is no way to enlarge this at all in the vertical mode in order to see more than 4 lines of text and edit them.  The only recommendation was to go landscape in order to get a wider bubble, which is still only 4 lines though.  Is there another way?
Next, and this could just be an issue with the app, but using the GPS which I do often, I get a text or email that I want/need to look at but the controls for the app only shrink it but it still covers up a lot of my messages even though I can move it around.  The ""home screen button"" just isn't there.  Suggestions?"
iso6qgCo6vI,absolutely first class. Thank you so much
iso6qgCo6vI,SO VERY HELPFUL!  THANKS!!
iso6qgCo6vI,Excellent video!  I learned a lot from this video and I want to Thank you!

iso6qgCo6vI,I liked this video! This video helped me a lot. Thanks! ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you so frustrating after watching twenty videos that only told me to power phone off(didn’t help) your tip to remove battery worked
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you so much.  Best instruction for new phone.  Please do more!!!!
iso6qgCo6vI,Very informative. Thanks
iso6qgCo6vI,Thanks so much for this video!  This is the first one I have watched where I actually understood the presenter in a manner I can understand and gain knowledge.  I am subscribing to your channel and will watch the others as well. Very much worth the time ~~
iso6qgCo6vI,Great details thanks love the video.❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you for your great tutorial.💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
iso6qgCo6vI,"I buy this today for 13,990. Your video help me a lot .am 57 year old.you educate me how to use cel..thank you so much. i subscribe"
iso6qgCo6vI,Fantastic presentation; thanks so much for taking the time to post this.
iso6qgCo6vI,EXCELLENT tutorial. THX!
iso6qgCo6vI,Very well presented. thank you.
iso6qgCo6vI,"I found this very informative and I thank you for it. I noticed when you were explaining voice text you did not use any punctuation. I’m having a major problem with voice texting because the system is spelling out the characters. ,?! Are being spelled out. How do we fix this? I appreciate your response. Thanks."
iso6qgCo6vI,It was all helpful. Thank you!
iso6qgCo6vI,Bought one a few days ago and the battery 🔋 quality is good I just installed a 256 sd card to transfer my apps and files on the card i heard about the A16 doesn't have a headset jack but you can get one online and it available at 5 below
iso6qgCo6vI,"I've always had a S Galaxy & the button's, ( volume, etc,etc) on the left side. It's driving me nuts that they switched  side. And always swiped down from the top, not up. Swiping from the homescreen, which should be set to easy mode for us older folks. I hope there is one Ui home. You've certainly covered in depth, which can get confusing. I just hit the button on the homescreen that is  all the apps & all your apps come up like pages in a book. This swiping up is very confusing. I don't mind turning the pages, so to speak. For older people we need things that are easy & also picking the accessibility for font, style of, magnifier for older people. Changing to dark mode. I've never been able to pick up my phone & talk. I always use speaker function. The first thing I wish I could do is get Google off my phone. I use Firefox for my browser. Google takes over everything, including my Gallery. They ruined my photos now, separating them into albums, etc,etc.
Whatever I do is stay away from Google. Of course, Google won't leave you alone. Firefox protects you, Google sells all your information. Well, now you're getting into the font size 😂.  Thank You"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Great video, very handy.  But as a first time cellphone owner, it may seem pretty basic, but when I just got it, no sim in it and no clue about setting up an account or service (I was advised to use public mobile) and I am fairly clueless about sims, though I do understand them a little bit.  Something for the absolute newbie, covering getting a sim, getting a service to use etc... would be helpful.  I noticed a lot of videos online assume you already have a sim and service, but I haven't found any to cover if you do not (I am on a computer presently).  I assume it is fairly straight forward and simple, but not when you don't know anything about these.  Thanks."
iso6qgCo6vI,Great video!!! What I am having trouble with...new phone....is screenshots. I found how to take them but seems very awkward. Maybe you'd have a tip for that some time! Thanks for this tutorial!
iso6qgCo6vI,It actually worked ❤
iso6qgCo6vI,Thx 4 this video...am having to rerun it a lot to make sure I know what I'm doing! ?4U: Can I use my sim card from my old tracfone [A11] Samsung Galaxy A15? What is a sim card anyway?
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thanks so much for the help! Really appreciate it. I'm still confused about how to set up SMS Messenger as default and why I should set up that one versus the existing red text. When I press set up as default button nothing happens. Also I'd love to know how I can move over my notes from notes app from old droid to new droid  rather than manually having to type them in. If you have other resources or ever decide to do video on these topics please let me know, but really GREAT video. I also LOVE that they have captions so if there's a topic that I need to focus on I can scan right to it. Thanks for your service. 😇"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Ditto everyone else.
Thank you"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Thank you, Wayne, for the video. Question on my a15 when I'm using an app or a game, and I get out of it just for a few min. When I  tried to return to the app or game using the 3 line bottom left button. the phone doesn't  let me return to where I  left off. The phone usually restarts the game or app I was using.  How do I  fix that ? Thank you, James"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Wayne, when you say the phone is ""asleep"" and accordingly still ON,  that suggests to me it is still using power and therefore draining the battery.  Would it therefore not be a better idea to turn it off completely to prevent this happening?"
iso6qgCo6vI,"Very nice video 
Tnx so much Bro"
iso6qgCo6vI,Thank you for the everything it was all helpful. How to save a new phone number?
iso6qgCo6vI,Good was great 👍 I pretty much know most of the things on the phone but still getting used to your phone so thank you for the other things I wasn't aware of the phone.   Does this phone have screenshot options
0yp6ygN3m3o,Whos here after they shattered their a15
0yp6ygN3m3o,"BRO, I’m 15, this is the second phone I’ve repaired and this time I repaired it properly no flimsy bits, it’s the glue part that messes me up as I don’t have the proper glue😂 but thanks so much, very informative 🎉"
0yp6ygN3m3o,"Thanks for the great video.🎉
You used several silver metallic clamps to hold your phone together at the end. Where do you get those, please, and what those called?"
0yp6ygN3m3o,Legend! This awesome guide helped me immensely ❤ Thank you!

0yp6ygN3m3o,How did u purchase the screen 5 years ago this phone didn't even exist 5 years ago
0yp6ygN3m3o,Use a little isopropyl alcohol to help loosen battery so you don’t pull so hard.
0yp6ygN3m3o,my screen went black and finally found a tutorial after buying a replacement screen
0yp6ygN3m3o,"damn, this bro buying parts for a phone 5 years before it came out"
0yp6ygN3m3o,"According to my calculations, 11 Dec 23 was a week and a half shy of 10 months ago. I’m assuming you meant 5 months ago though lol.  Thank you for the walk through!"
0yp6ygN3m3o,Where do you  buy new screen at

0yp6ygN3m3o,Thank you!
0yp6ygN3m3o,"I wonder if you are still here.... I bought the screen from Ali express and yes it also marked Service Pack.. but the quality is so faded and slow and not super sensitive.
Can you tell me where can I get the original screen please and if it is Amoled or just regular LCD"
0yp6ygN3m3o,I have same phone  with same problem  please  give the total cost
0yp6ygN3m3o,"After replacing my screen, the touch was twitching after 3 days😢"
0yp6ygN3m3o,How much screen A 15
0yp6ygN3m3o,"Thought it was the glass you replaced, but you just replaced the whole front end and frame."
0yp6ygN3m3o,For some reason I still get a black screen after replacement
0yp6ygN3m3o,Ty so much!!!
0yp6ygN3m3o,My phone is not powering up after breaking the screen.
0yp6ygN3m3o,"This is not a broken glass repair, It is rather a replacement."
0yp6ygN3m3o,Can you make another video without replacing the frame together?

0yp6ygN3m3o,How to fix a15 ghost touch problem
pfOUdk6PpsY,The most important thing for me is the android update policy (a15 gives u 4 major updates and a16 dives u 6 major updates). that means the a16 will take longer to become obsolete!
pfOUdk6PpsY,Prácticamente es lo mismo.
pfOUdk6PpsY,"Defo a15, cheaper while having same features and also 3.5mm headphone jack"
pfOUdk6PpsY,A16❤❤❤❤
pfOUdk6PpsY,Le A16 aura android 20 dans le futur ou rien a voir ?
pfOUdk6PpsY,A16 better❤😊
pfOUdk6PpsY,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

N5TvRBS6wxg,Screen recording ?
N5TvRBS6wxg,"Be aware that the A15 is NOT hearing aid compatible. Just found out the hard way bought this model to replace an elderly A21s for more storage and better screen . The A21s is compatible I ,thought that all galaxy phones were not so. Perhaps Samsung could do an update for A15s to incorporate hearing aid support. I found a workarabound if you have a baha 6 and a minimic you can stream via the mic as there is a 3.5mm jack incorporated in it and you can plug a 3.5mm to 3.5mm lead to the phone bit cumbersome but it works."

Usvu6GLvo6U,I'm using the A15 5g for a month now. No real complaints.
Usvu6GLvo6U,A15 is an emulation beast too. Can play 90% of the legal roms you own for the ps2 and everything before ps2 runs at perfectly.
Usvu6GLvo6U,I just bought an A15 for $60 bucks on marketplace from some rich family in the north imei was good and everything.
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I have the a15 4g. Great display, battery life, headphone jack, stable OS, software support is good, especially for the price. My only complaint is that the phone is big. I wish they made budget phones at 6 inches."
Usvu6GLvo6U,Got mine this week love the A/series samsung galaxy's my favorite phones they are great for my business
Usvu6GLvo6U,"No headphone jack on the A16 🤔, I'll stick with my A15"
Usvu6GLvo6U,I have A11 and I am still wondering to this day how come all its predecessors have teardrop notch? One reason I am still 50/50 on upgrading 😞.
Usvu6GLvo6U,I have a 16 5g but it has mediatek 6300 it's very good for gaming
Usvu6GLvo6U,Which is best sound quality
Usvu6GLvo6U,"BRING BACK THE HEADPHONE JACK
BRING BACK THE HEADPHONE JACK"
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Simply go for the A16 you will never regret,  dont look donw on the audio jack🎉🎉"
Usvu6GLvo6U,"This was an unfair comparison because the A16 has 8GB of RAM while the A15 has only 4GB of RAM. The A16 will have better performance going back and forth between apps.
In the United States you can only get 4GB of RAM with either of these models."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Talking about the A15 being slow.
Could it run google maps and play spotify in the background without turning spoitfy off, or when switching back to spotify stop the navigation? Or run Android Auto at all.
My A41 can't, it insta closes any ""bigger"" app when i turn on something else. And never really uses all 4Gb of ram it's apparently got."
Usvu6GLvo6U,From M11 to A16. It seems good upgrade
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I'll be upgrading to 1 of these 2 from a A03s so in comparison I doubt that personally I'll find anything ""disappointing"" heh"
Usvu6GLvo6U,Which one has the best camera?
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I just bought the A15 5G at Target for $75, but I haven't opened or activated it yet and can return it.  Should I keep it, or should I return it and buy the A16 5G for $150?"
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I have the A16, I'll be back after I did my emulators. But exenos has ALWAYS been horrible for me since a10."
Usvu6GLvo6U,The a16 5g dosnt seem to have really any difference from the a15 5g....yes a few things are different but....I mean not to me worth calling an upgrade they could have just gave an update to the a15 5g for the difference (well not the hardware obviously)
Usvu6GLvo6U,15 for size. 16 for EIS control when taking vidz
Usvu6GLvo6U,I rather go with the A16
Usvu6GLvo6U,I got my a15 completely free at Walmart when I bought my 45$ monthly plan from straight talk.
Usvu6GLvo6U,You just have to turn off the animation and other gimmicks in developer mode. Phone runs snappy
Usvu6GLvo6U,A15 is the best 👌 😅😅😅
Usvu6GLvo6U,Kun sa best h 15 ya 16
Usvu6GLvo6U,We own several pairs of good headphones.  ..we will *NOT* be buying wireless headphones
Usvu6GLvo6U,No headphone jack = I won't buy it
Usvu6GLvo6U,Would the a15 5g better then the a15 base?
Usvu6GLvo6U,I brought my a16 from the Samsung shop for £169 which I think is a bit to cheap especially for the 5g version
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Is vice-versa, dude... A15 has a glossy back."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I just got the A 16 no phone jack,but it's a little powerful phone"
Usvu6GLvo6U,"They're both the same phone except the following....
16 is larger height wise
16 no headphone jack
16 screen fingerprint sensor



Other than that.... Same phone."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Okay i want to buy my mom present for her b-day. And I’m thinking between these two, but i’m not sure which one to get?"
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Definitely NOT worth it, the A16 doesn't have a headphone jack, to all A15 owners, stick with your current phone (unless you wanna upgrade to a Samsung A2X i.e. A25 or A26), the Samsung A15 is perfect as it is.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not saying that the Samsung Galaxy A16 is a bad phone, it's definitely awesome. 😊 But if you're more old school and love auxiliary cables, wired headphones or earphones, then this phone is not for you, however if you have Bluetooth headphones, Samsung airpods, a Bluetooth car radio (for listening to music in your car) then by all means, go ahead and get the A16! But only if you can survive without having a headphone jack! 😂😅"
Usvu6GLvo6U,I have an a15 5g and I like it...I wanted the a25 5g But at the time my provider didn't support it (the day I bought the a15 when I was adding it to my phone account the listed it as a supported phone lol go figure..... I am surprised though that samsung hasn't Really put any advertising into the a16 5g As in there's literally nothing about it on their website it's not even listed for sale
Usvu6GLvo6U,"The teardrop notch should be irradicated, it makes the bezel worse and makes the phone look dated."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Nice comparison. My opinion on these two is that the A16 is worse than the A15 in every way other than its update policy. 

The A16 has weird extremely uneven bezels, dropped the headphone jack, too big and has way worse battery drain than the A15.

None of the A1x series are fast thats to be expected. If the A15 had the dual sim with sd card tray like the A14 did it would be near budget perfection. 

Im not sure why the A16 was released, the A15 didnt even get its full year."
Usvu6GLvo6U,I like the A16 because it doesn't have the jack so I'll upgrade from my a15 to that
Usvu6GLvo6U,Not an upgrade. ..no headphone jack
Usvu6GLvo6U,A16 lost me at the headphone jack
Usvu6GLvo6U,🇩🇿📸
Usvu6GLvo6U,Them reviews really fooled me that a15 was literal laggy garbagé
Usvu6GLvo6U,This phone is sf slippery it slides out of your grip every chance it gets
Usvu6GLvo6U,Dude already damaged it lol frame scuffed
Usvu6GLvo6U,"These type of phones were made for 3rd world countries, that's why they gave all these cheap android phones the galaxy tag, so that people can brag that they have a galaxy phone. I personally think it was a bad business move because it brings down the galaxy name."
Usvu6GLvo6U,Is it any good compared to 2023 Samsung galaxy A14 5G
o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you for the video. Great work as always!!!
o6yNybwt0hM,"I just got this phone and love it so far. I literally ordered it online, added a sturdy case and had it delivered to my workplace in about 40 minutes, all for under $200 inclusing taxes and delivery fees/tips. It is a lot of bang for your buck as they say. Some of the features I like are the screen quality, fingerprint reader, micro SD card capability and the food old fashioned head phone jack."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Had an A15 5g for a little while, before having to switch back to at&t, now having a base s24. The s24 may be more premium, but i genuinely miss my old A15 5g. That thing rocked."
o6yNybwt0hM,"I previously owns galaxy m31 since 2020, now i bought galaxy a15 5g new  , experience is awesome fluid, lag free, 5g network coverage is awesome, battery performance in 5g is awesome, sound is loud and clear. I'm from india, my first phone was also Samsung in 2008,"
o6yNybwt0hM,Just got this because my trusty A51 BRICKED! Good thing I had everything backed up. I really like the fingerprint reader on the thumb instead on the screen. Got a really good armor case for it and it feel rock solid. Looking forward to a good long life with it!
o6yNybwt0hM,Great content. Thank you. I just ordered mine. I too am disgusted by $1000+ electronic leashes.
o6yNybwt0hM,"My new phone got stolen (s24, no insurance, yeah I know lol). Had to pull my backup phone out of retirement (iphone 8 plus, still in great condition, using it right now btw) but that left me having to buy another phone outright (I keep 2 phones). Found this phone on Amazon and should receive soon. Didn’t think “cheap” phones still existed but I’m so glad they do. I don’t need all the bells and whistles so this A15 will be just fine for my needs but its funny to think this “cheap” phone is basically what phones were 5-10 years ago lol. Amazing."
o6yNybwt0hM,The Blue Samsung Galaxy A15 8gb of RAM with a Storage of 256gb with a Micro SD card slot 2tb ready
o6yNybwt0hM,"Am a seventy-year-old new Galaxy A15 user. It's been less than two weeks. As a senior, there's always a learning curve on any new device. The user manual is a joke! What's the deal with a C-to-C charger cable? Luckily, I still had a C to USB charger cable from my old phone."
o6yNybwt0hM,I purchased the Samsung A15 two weeks ago and am still learning how to use it.  So far I like it if I can remember my new phone number on it.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Was at the store yesterday, couldn't help noticing the Galaxy A15 has a yellowish tint on its display, eventhough the eye comfort feature has been unchecked. Comparing it side by side with the A05, the latter didn't have the same prob."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Typing on A15 from India and ohere there are 3 variant,  4gb , 6gb, 8gb ram with 128gb or 256gb rom. Bought it yesterday and working pretty well 😌"
o6yNybwt0hM,This is the right phone for my 77 years old Mom ❤ and Unt 😁 thanks for the info.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Hmmmmm, you didn't mention, either in your pros or cons opinion, anything regarding the camera system.  I know people who do want a budget-type phone with a good camera.  I enjoy your reviews a lot and have suggested several phones to friends and family based on your videos."
o6yNybwt0hM,"Overall, this seems like a great device.  Would you say all areas of performance are really good?  Multitasking, phone calls, texting, etc.  I really wish Samsung would have put dual speakers on this phone and given it some form of protection.   Both gorllla glass and water/dust resistance.  It doesn’t have to be top of the line protection but something."
o6yNybwt0hM,"I have the Samsung Galaxy A15 5 G, but some of the texts I receive say to tap & download, but nothing the little blue thing just keeps circling.  How can I fix this so I get to read all my text messages?"
o6yNybwt0hM,For the price it has no cons you get what you pay for
o6yNybwt0hM,"#1, too heavy.  Much of what you said is Greek to me LOL.  I do agree with the charging.  I wasn't thrilled to have such a ton of apps pre loaded, but I'm an old lady & mostly just use phone, messaging and maps."
o6yNybwt0hM,the pros were spot on the cons were very specific to your experience only thank you
o6yNybwt0hM,"Mine has been freezing up, and at times, you can't restart it or shut it off. Coming from far more expensive phones it's fine but I don't like how thick it is and the size is too short but I knew this going in. 
I don't like the power button as it seems harder to find than most others at night.
The screen capture works, but it was far easier to find and figure out on my previous phones.

In the end I am fine with it. The freezing started after the last update, and hopefully, it will get sorted out."
o6yNybwt0hM,Charging the a14 might be set to adaptive so it slow charges then hurrys up the last 20% depending on how long you leave it on the charger. Not sure if you messed with it yet.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Love your videos, man! Pretty sure I'll be grabbing a couple of these for my Daughters at Christmas time!"
o6yNybwt0hM,I love the finger bio-metric button. It works like a charm.
o6yNybwt0hM,How does Samsung A15 128gb compare to Moto G stylus 5g 256gb. Looking forward to your response. Thank you..
o6yNybwt0hM,The only issue I have with a15 5g is that there isn't a default screen recording. I was wondering why. Do you know?
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone yesterday switched from iphone 12 + to a15 5g but i think its 4gb so 4ram ? Im nervous but i like this phone alot .😢
o6yNybwt0hM,"Thanks  for  the review ! I was  also disappointed that the A15  has  4Gb of ram in 2024. Teardrop  notch vs  punch hole  doesn't  bother me. No 25 watt charger included ?? Come on.   Like   the 4 year  OS upgrades and brighter , smaller super amoled  screen.  On the  fence  though.  Considering   Moto g power 5G. 2023..  more  ram,(6Gb)   more storage , stereo speakers Even though  it only has 1  upgrade to Android 14,  its  always  goes on sale(199.99 unlocked). I still have a  moto g Play  from 2018,lol .Samsung phones never   go on sale (unlocked) even  when  new  models  are about to come  out."
o6yNybwt0hM,Is this phone good for general purpose like phone calls youtube camera and stuff...??? Shld i buy this ...
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got it for my birthday yesterday
o6yNybwt0hM,"I just got the A15 and will say it is an upgrade, but not a massive upgrade. However, I am still happy with the A13."
o6yNybwt0hM,"iam a long term samsung user.
decided to change to other due to exynos issue since iam a gamer.
decided to go with redmi pro 13+.but it became expensive.

so came back to samung again
and torn between m34 and A15.
leaning more towards A15 due to its dimenity 6100+ comared to m34 exynos 1280.
hope samsung releases more midrange with other chips"
o6yNybwt0hM,My brother loves this phone so much that he just purchased another one.
o6yNybwt0hM,Would this be an upgrade from an iPhone xr?
o6yNybwt0hM,"As an older person who wanted just a Phone simple and simple. This phone is not simple. I came from a LG K8. Which was simple.  I only use a few apps.  PHONES should only come with a few apps and allow us to add what we want. I like using Maps apps and geocache.  Both needing a GPS sensor, triangulation and It has a crappy Sensor!!!  It can only get to within 12 meters. Vs 3 meters of my older phone. I'm So disappointed I've gone back to using my older phone."
o6yNybwt0hM,What's the thing with the bezels - near perfect design and the bezels are not an issue at all.
o6yNybwt0hM,Is it better than the moto g stylus 5g 2023?
o6yNybwt0hM,"What storage version you have? Cause I saw in another video there is a version of 256gb storage, that is pretty damn good for the price"
o6yNybwt0hM,"I've still got my Samsung A51, and I've had it 5 years now and absolutely love it, but I know I need an upgrade, and this phone keeps calling me 😅"
o6yNybwt0hM,U do a great job on the phone reviews. Concise and to the point with CLEAR ENGLISH.
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone a few days ago and it's amazing i love it 😍😍
o6yNybwt0hM,if i want to upgrade to this is it worth it is it cameras good or should i go flagship
o6yNybwt0hM,"My pro: Pretty decent budget phone for 2024 model of phones.
My con: It doesn't have a slot for both a SIM 2 and a microSD card.
Although they did compensate with their 125Gb of storage.

In all, it's a pretty nice phone for minimalist users."
o6yNybwt0hM,How is the camera?
o6yNybwt0hM,"I'm still pretty happy with my galaxy s10, but the battery is on it's last leg and I hate that there won't be any upgrades anymore, if this doesn't suck/is worse than my old one, I'd totally chose this. Does this compare or is it worse? And yes, I'm old school, I still use wire bound headphones, the regular blue tooth ones never seem to fit my stupid ears and the cloud storage/ the internal storage doesn't cut it for my extensive music library 😅"
o6yNybwt0hM,"Reminds me of the samsung j1, simple but got the job done"
o6yNybwt0hM,"Thank you for the great review. It made things much more clear for me and helped me in making my decision. Even though I don't subscribe to tech channels because I'm not really into that kind of stuff, I subscribed to yours. Very much appreciated."
o6yNybwt0hM,Ordered one today - will come back and let you know how it went.
o6yNybwt0hM,Need to buy a new phone and I don't know what to choose moto edge 2023 moto g 5g pixel 7 or the Samsung A15 5g what would you suggest
o6yNybwt0hM,Just bought  the A15...several things I don't really like about it but so far it's ok.
o6yNybwt0hM,In just my day to day living I have never heard anyone complain about the bezels on their phones. Except tech YouTubers. Also once you slap an OtterBox (my choice of case) on your phone you literally don't notice them anyway. As long as the viewing experience is good and the battery life is good I am very happy with this phone.
o6yNybwt0hM,I got mine on amazon for $170 WITH 256 gigs of storage and 8 gigs of ram! New and unlocked
o6yNybwt0hM,I just got this phone today and Really it's nice
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it get really hot to hold after awhile because heat was an issue in my other phone
o6yNybwt0hM,"My A15 5G's screen is far too sensitive. I bump it, switch hands, etc,  it lights up, leading to opening apps by ""accident"". It's a nearly constant problem. The slow charging has only recently become a problem."
o6yNybwt0hM,Why can't I find the 256gb version anywhere from american websites without it being an international version of the phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks very much for those details ❤
o6yNybwt0hM,Thanks for the review.
o6yNybwt0hM,The phone is very good and the future is also great
o6yNybwt0hM,Gonna buy this maybe nextweek 😊
o6yNybwt0hM,Hello guys! Is your galaxy a15 a little yellowish like it's always on blue light filter cause mine is kinda look like that and I can't see in settings where I can make it a bit in a cooler tone
o6yNybwt0hM,There's samsung a15 on ebay that has 64gb instead of 128gb is the other upgrades the same?
o6yNybwt0hM,My mom is wanting to get me a new phone before I leave for college I don't need much so this one seems good for my needs thanks for the detailed review!! Personally I like the teardrop cameras but that's just a matter of taste ofc.
o6yNybwt0hM,"Regarding the cons: wider bezels and the dimple at the top - not looking up-to-date - are the last 2 things I would consider when buying any phone. A smartphone is a tool, and not something to show off. It's kind of like worrying about having an ugly bolt in the trunk of my car.

I don't play video games - most users don't. I want performance and speed, reliability and durability. This is a backup for me, and slower than my Pixel 8, but not so much that I couldn't use it. Camera isn't as good. A screen protector and case will make it far more durable for a cost of $10 to $15 - I've used them on flagships as well, and have never broken a phone or a screen."
o6yNybwt0hM,Hey Sir is it true that this galaxy a15 has a green line issue ???
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it have a screen recorder ? Or is it like the old models we have to wait for an update ?
o6yNybwt0hM,"I had an issue with my new A15 communicating with Android Auto on my truck. All my other phones have worked over the years, not this one. It takes forever to load and none of the touch screen features work. The map eventually loads, but does not track my progress. I have arranged for a replacement with my provider, so hoping the new one will work okay. Anyone else have an issue with Android Auto and the A15?"
o6yNybwt0hM,"Hi thanks for the info just  purchased in mauritius but it is  made in India.
 Is it OK ???
Thank"
o6yNybwt0hM,I just inherited my newly late sisters passing. She always used the same password for Everything. Near her end... she changed her password... I can't get in. I don't want to lose her contacts or last moments🥺. Could someone help me??? 😢😭🙏
o6yNybwt0hM,"Helpful review, thanks.
I was looking at getting this but devices not to after this. I can pick up a better second hand phone that's  not much more expensive. Now to decide which one."
o6yNybwt0hM,great video mate
o6yNybwt0hM,"I have the A15, but not 5G version i think. Do you know if this can be charged wirelessly?"
o6yNybwt0hM,I just purchased this phone and its awesome..Great video
o6yNybwt0hM,90hz display on a mid range galaxy. iPhone non pro models are 60hz still and cost several hundred more dollars.
o6yNybwt0hM,"I was so happy to learn from the comments here that I could insert my SD card under the SIM card, but the photos on the SD card came up as distorted, although on my computer, they looked just fine. We removed & re-inserted the SIM & SD card several times, but it didn't help the distortion. Also we rebooted the phone several times. Does anyone have a suggestion for me? Loved the video!"
o6yNybwt0hM,"As of Nov 22, 2024, Amazon has this phone at $115, 'refurbished'(Excellent condition). Just bought one and will try it with Mint mobile. Can you believe Deadpool has a phone company🤯"
o6yNybwt0hM,Nice review. Notice any PWM flicker ?
o6yNybwt0hM,Bezels are Good because they prevent accidental App launches or changing screens from the home screen.
o6yNybwt0hM,Any way to get rid of the freezing and lag with this phone?? Having really bad issues with this one.
o6yNybwt0hM,"I Just Use my Phone📲 for Basic web browser, Social Media, Email, photos, etc stuff like That, It's the *Samsung Galaxy J7 Crown📱?*
*💁🏿‍♂️How much of a Upgrade would this Samsung A15 📱be compared to That model?*"
o6yNybwt0hM,I don't like that I don't see in the gallery where you can select specific pictures to share either in text messages or email. Also there is no option to receive voice notifications on who's calling or texting me. I had both those features on my LG stylo 6 which I used all the time. Do you happen to know ifthose options are in the Samsung A15  5G phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,Is Samsung Pay compatible with this phone?
o6yNybwt0hM,I purchased the Galaxy A15 5G same day while adding text contacts on my phone an ER message popped up requesting to enter my pin to unlock my phone. I don't know why my phone locked and where do I find my pin.
o6yNybwt0hM,The notch is not a big deal to me because you can usually hide the notch on any app you want and the only app that I want to hide the notch on is for YouTube.
o6yNybwt0hM,The teardrop camera lens area is cleaned more easily compared to a phone with a screen protector having a cutout dot.
o6yNybwt0hM,Is this supposed to come with a sim card?  Mine didn't (Best Buy).  Can i use the sim from my A15 4G?
o6yNybwt0hM,I have the A13 and really wish this one were the same size. This one feels too thick and chunky.
o6yNybwt0hM,Thank you for saying it's not waterproof. It's an important thing if you live in Ireland where it rains often. My modest Oppo a16s is waterproof and is going strong after 2 years.
o6yNybwt0hM,Does it support OTG Memory Sticks ?  What is the maximum memory size that can be added ? Thanks!
o6yNybwt0hM,Simple question. Buy a case or not? Do people still buy cases like I always do?
o6yNybwt0hM,As of today I actually got this phone at Walmart for 66$ with tax included. Not a bad rig for the price as a straight talk phone
o6yNybwt0hM,"Hi, I currently have the Samsung Galaxy S10e...would this phone be an upgrade from my current phone or am I better off staying with my phone?"
o6yNybwt0hM,I’ve had mine for 2 weeks now. I need to get a different charging cable as it doesn’t charge. I’m using my cable from my a10e. Also…I can’t set my notifications to differentiate between text and other notifications. Thx for the video.
o6yNybwt0hM,"I dropped my A14 in the rain. Picked it up, and kept walking. It was a light rain, not a down-poor. Just a minute and a half in a light rain. It was enough to kill it. I had the phone in a shock protection case. So, it wasn't the drop. I tried to start it, and the phone was overheating. It was making a buzzing sound, and it was dead. I was just walking in the grass and dropped the phone, and a person behind me said, ""You dropped your phone."" I walked back and picked it up. It just had a sprinkling of rain on it, and it was dead. I guess I was lucky. I've used the phone in the rain before, and it got more wet at that time.  Okay phone, as long as it does rain where you are. Kind of expensive otherwise."
o6yNybwt0hM,Are motorola photos better because they have gorilla glass screen on them with a snapdragon 680
o6yNybwt0hM,"Bro, Is your phone blinking its screen during call 📞? Or is it by company. Please guide me."
o6yNybwt0hM,are you from Europe? Why don't you have 8gb ram there? We have that option here in the Philippines and I'm planning to get a15 on the weekends.
o6yNybwt0hM,"I had it for a few hours. It lagged and stuttered with just basic use, including Samsung's own apps. It was so bad that I returned it the same day."
o6yNybwt0hM,I don't know about other countries but In Nepal we get free 25 watt Samsung original charger with phone itself and the base variant of this device in Nepal is 6/128 so it's perfect to buy
o6yNybwt0hM,"Samsung is good, the bad thing only is the design.. Xiaomi had outsmarted Samsung when it comes to design 📢"
o6yNybwt0hM,Does the A15 have always on display?

MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine yesterday. The moment I saw it, I fell in love"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I watched it once before, and that was my reaction too! As a beginner, when the person explaining how to use this is talking that fast, it's too fast to process each thing, before he moves to the next thing, etc"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Got Two Today From My Telco
Thanks for Your help ✌️👍"
MN0qF-mAAyo,Thank you so much. I just got mine today 👍👍
MN0qF-mAAyo,I just bought mine. Love it
MN0qF-mAAyo,Very good explanation of this device.  Thank you for doing this.  My only difficulty was it was hard for me to digest what you were saying because - in my view - you talk too fast.
MN0qF-mAAyo,I love my A15. It goes great with my AR15.
MN0qF-mAAyo,Thank you for this!
MN0qF-mAAyo,I can't understand what you're saying and you're going too fast to follow.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I got mine today on the samsung publicity video it says use smart switch to transfer your applications from another samsung phone, my new A 15 5g didn't have it and it took over an hour to install it,"
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Thank you so much, loved it!!"

MN0qF-mAAyo,Merci. very helpful 🇭🇹🎀🌻🍒
MN0qF-mAAyo,"I bought one of these yesterday but there's nothing on it. I can't believe I'm asking this, but how do I use it as a phone? I don't get that screen you got there at the beginning. No search bar, no apps under it. It's been a couple of hours since they deactivated my old phone, which was about 24 hours since I bought it. Do I need to wait? I phoned my Galaxy from my landline but it says it has not been possible to connect my call."

MN0qF-mAAyo,How do I receive voicemail?
MN0qF-mAAyo,"Taken me days to sort out the camera and sound configuration after they went wrong. The phone (it’s a phone!) has too many technical features. Ok, It was bought in 2024 while my other phones are older and much easier to use."
MN0qF-mAAyo,A15❤
MN0qF-mAAyo,"For the instructional video, you will need to speak more slowly. You are here to teach people how to use an unknown device, especially for older people and twice especially for those with English as a second language.. So, instead of 9 minutes 31 seconds, spend 15 minutes. Thank you."
MN0qF-mAAyo,He seems to b in a hurry! Still confused😢

MN0qF-mAAyo,Is this one better or the galaxy a24?
MN0qF-mAAyo,I Did not find this as  basic as  I  needed.   Never having had a Samsung phone before.   Plus I found you spoke too fast.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"You’re speaking to seniors and beginners. You speak too fast, too soft and don’t articulate your words. Appreciate the intent but could improve for your audience"

MN0qF-mAAyo,Where is the screenshot
MN0qF-mAAyo,Very difficult to follow you as you speak way too quickly. You need to slow down so the listener can properly absorb what you have said.
MN0qF-mAAyo,"You speak to fast and do not enunciate well. It's had to follow your descriptions. I had to set the closed captions and still you speak so fast, no pauses between phrases to absorb what you're saying."
MN0qF-mAAyo,Unlock device have forgot'n password
MN0qF-mAAyo,I bought a Galaxy A15 but it gets stuck

il2QoQXkU_4,"I have a Samsung A15 4/128, it works great, nothing lags, everything is fine in games too, but I don't like the camera, it adds brightness and looks unnatural"
il2QoQXkU_4,Why did they place that notch screen?
il2QoQXkU_4,"La verdad es un buen celular yo temgo uno es el que utilizo es muy bueno y tiene una carga superrapida, No es un carga rapida"
il2QoQXkU_4,"N189000😮😮, here in SA it's R4000"

il2QoQXkU_4,"Warning! AVOID SAMSUNG. I bought a Galaxy 24 Ultra 512 GB. The phone was constantly warm, the battery life was worse than on my S23+ and the fast charging didn´t work. Very bad quality. Contacted their technical support but they we unable to help me becaure the diagnostics system didn´t work for a whole week. They told me to take the phone to a repair shop. Unbelieveble! They want to repair a couple of weeks old premium phone ?!?! My feeling is that they do not care about their customers. Feels that you´re paying for a Ferrari buy they deliver a Lada. I do NOT recomment this device, it will disappoint you. I will not buy another Samsung product. Really bad service and while the technical support can´t help it is impossible to speak to somebody responsible."
il2QoQXkU_4,I’m getting that phone today

il2QoQXkU_4,"Are all the 15 numeral Samsung phones the same or is it a regional thing. I was interested in the F15 for a budget workshop, but it's for the India region."

B1iNXMGoj9I,"Samsung may be better than redmi or xiaomi in the flagship segment but in this price segment shown in the video, redmi really steals the spotlight be it from camera to performance to basically everything. I have used both redmi and samsung and this is my conclusion becuase samsung really loses it in the lower segment"
B1iNXMGoj9I,I already got my samsung today😊
B1iNXMGoj9I,"This is why I have a samsung in my hands instead of a Chinese phone.
Edit: chill, I didn't know that much about phones jeez"
B1iNXMGoj9I,Frames redmi note 13😍
B1iNXMGoj9I,"""that was a long wait for both""

Oh no it is my net loading 😅"
B1iNXMGoj9I,Eu não sabia que as opções de desligamento da redmi eram assim...
B1iNXMGoj9I,Samsung A15 It has low-quality photos (Selfies) and the price-performance ratio compared to Xiaomi is incomparable... If the higher-class Samsung A52 s05g or the already 6-year-old Samsung A44 are of much better quality and still perform well....
B1iNXMGoj9I,I have both samsung and redmi in terms of body and screen Redmi is more strong but in term of software samsung UI is really very good bloat ware free.
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Both are great and enough, if you just need a phone"
B1iNXMGoj9I,Those bezels be looking like iphone 3gs😭
B1iNXMGoj9I,"ufs vs emmc, Even though Samsung's loading is a bit faster compared to Redmi, in terms of performance, for me it's still Redmi and the price of Redmi is cheaper, bro."
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Ga ngaruh cepet lama mati idup nya tuh hp.. Yang penting xiaomi redmi selalu memberikan yang terbaik dari segi kapasitas ram dan memory 

Dan sangat membantu dari kalangan bawah bs menikmati spek mewah harga merakyat


Beda sama samsung 
Spek kecil harga selangit 😂🤣😂🤣

Makanya harga jual xiaomi redmi lbh laris drpd samsung 
#FAKTA#"
B1iNXMGoj9I,"I have Samsung






































But I simply refuse to be one to say it's the king or it's the best"
B1iNXMGoj9I,A25 vs Redmi note 13
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Sd685 , an old arm version set architecture , no matter how much u overclock it , its still older tech , so newer will always be most efficient for use"
B1iNXMGoj9I,I have a samsung galaxy a15
B1iNXMGoj9I,The Bezels on samsung💀
B1iNXMGoj9I,"So, which is better?"
B1iNXMGoj9I,The reason is that Samsung has a better processor.
B1iNXMGoj9I,Don't buy Samsung galaxy A35 mobile overheating and Decrease charge waste of money 😡😡😡

B1iNXMGoj9I,I have redmi note 13 its good super good pictures good gaming experiance but reboot is small slow
B1iNXMGoj9I,Xiaomi the best
B1iNXMGoj9I,The reason why Redmi has a longer one it has a big system and Samsung has a mid kind system
B1iNXMGoj9I,Samsung A32❤

B1iNXMGoj9I,What is the best phone for buy? (Redmi note 13 or samsung galaxy a15) I want to buy
B1iNXMGoj9I,A15 loads quicker because Redmi has alot of stuff to load for quicker performance.
B1iNXMGoj9I,Koho zajímá rychlost zapnutí telefonu 😂😂
B1iNXMGoj9I,Redmi buyutful
B1iNXMGoj9I,Çerçeve oranı fazla kamera çentiği de fazla almam aga
B1iNXMGoj9I,Redmi lose samsung but Xiaomi 13ultra camera and price....... Leica is best but samsung is a king
B1iNXMGoj9I,You should've unlocked the samsung because the boot up process doesn't end on the lockscreen
B1iNXMGoj9I,Redmi note 13❤
B1iNXMGoj9I,A15 vs redmi 13 gelsin
B1iNXMGoj9I,Samsung look like cheap phone 😂
B1iNXMGoj9I,Redmi literally lagged there when unlocked
B1iNXMGoj9I,"PARA MIM :  REDMI NOTE 13,MUITO BOM MESMO.😊😅"
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Arada 2,5 k fark var  redmi çöp 😅"
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Купил Редми 12 про,через сутки сдал обратно,бабла накинвл и купил самсунг А 54,доволен как слон)"
B1iNXMGoj9I,"It's fine, samsung can't relate on modding side"
B1iNXMGoj9I,Both phones are in my home😅😅😅
B1iNXMGoj9I,I like redmi note 13 because it was very as stange as  a15
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Parece un modelo del 2015 contra uno del 2024, si Samsung mejorará sus diseños en la gala baja sería el mejor"
B1iNXMGoj9I,emmc ?
B1iNXMGoj9I,Redmi Note 13 is best.
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Samsung A15 super.
Men yangi oldim 
Samsung baribir samsung"
B1iNXMGoj9I,Samsung has Lags i have the redmi Note 13 and i can Say this phone is better then the a15
B1iNXMGoj9I,Mine was a Note 13 too.
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Gw punya redmi note 11s (skrg terpaksa ""pendi"" krn mau ganti ke apel krowak).. start awal/restart pasti lama.. kirain penyakit ini bakal ilang di redmi berikutnya, ternyata sama aja 😂😂😂"
B1iNXMGoj9I,Kon winner ha ?
B1iNXMGoj9I,Smasung nasıl da sapladı ama en iyi modeli😊😊
B1iNXMGoj9I,Looks like 400$ vs 125$
B1iNXMGoj9I,Redmi note 13 Samsung Galaxy A15 den daha iyi
B1iNXMGoj9I,O certo seria comparar com o A25. Pq todo mundo quer comparar o Redmi Note 12/13 com o A14/A15 ?? Tem nada haver.
B1iNXMGoj9I,چند است قیمت
B1iNXMGoj9I,Where are you from ?
B1iNXMGoj9I,Huawei y7
B1iNXMGoj9I,Notice how every chinese brand has that same restart animaton they just change the logos
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Trust me guys ,i watching this on  redmi 13 ,mate the rest Is slow, but the rest are much more fastet than A35"
B1iNXMGoj9I,У меня. Xiaomi redmi note 13😅😂
B1iNXMGoj9I,"Pero ahora vamos a las pruebas de rendimiento a largo plazo, el Redmi se lo lleva por Mucho"

What are your thoughts on the A15 5G? Thanks for watching!"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Last week I bought 2 of these Samsung Galaxy A15 5G from Best Buy for a great price and gave one of them to my wife to replace her old phone that had a swollen battery that’s about to explode. The second one I use to put music on so when I’m riding my electric moped I can listen to music with instead of my iPhone 11 Pro Max on my handlebars. The look, the build quality and the performance of the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is amazing and now I switched to this one to use as my daily driver. My iPhone is in the top drawer for now until further notice and I’ll have to get me a much cheaper phone to use while I’m riding."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I ordered one for $152 and its crazy to think cheap phones are THIS good already. 
I'm going to use it for banking and security apps mostly so the 4-5 years of software support is a big plus to me."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I ordered mine off of HSN for $100.  It comes with tracfone service, but after I use it up I am going to by a sim card for another carrier. Honestly, I had the Samsung A13 for 2 years and loved it.  I just needed a little more storage and this phone fits my needs perfectly."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"In July 2024, I bought the Galaxy A15 5G from Best Buy for $220.  I like the quick charging, but I don't like how difficult it can be to take screenshots.  The Galaxy S9 was my fave."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I bought a15 5g at 20k INR in navy blue 
This is good and giving good battery life and not heat when gaming but warm😢 
It's is samsung best seeling a series phone in 2023"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I Switched From An Iphone 12 , Was A Bit Skeptical At First But This Phone Is Amazing , Battery Life , Storage , Customization Options Top Notch ! Will Not Be Purchasing Apple Again !"
6NBH0KLLe9s,I wanted to get the s54 but the cricket store was out of stock so I ended up getting an a15 and I have to say I've been quite pleased with it. It's not the fastest thing on the planet but it is a MASSIVE upgrade from the galaxy a10e I've been using for the past 5 years. I'm not a fan of switching phones every year or two and this phone does everything I want much better than my old phone so I don't  feel too bad about missing out on the more souped up s54.
6NBH0KLLe9s,2:20 glad Samsung is still keeping the headphone jack on the A Series phone! But it’s completely gone from the S Series phones
6NBH0KLLe9s,"This is the phone that I really want for just making phone calls, googling, whatsapp'ing and nothing more. Not in a million years should I spend 1.9K for a foldable Z phone just to break after a couple years."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I find it funny that all the smartphone reviews never do a segment on how the phone does on making phone calls and how it sounds when talking to someone. Its all about playing stupid games and taking pictures and crap like that,instead of whata phone is used for, to make a phone call..."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Just bought one for 360$ with everything its a dope phone and the camera and videos are crazy
6NBH0KLLe9s,"The ram management example was very helpful, thank you."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Made my day to see you have OSRS ❤
6NBH0KLLe9s,Just ordered one of these - will report back on experience - BUT - based on reports.... for the price... pretty sure I'll be very happy.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"6:58 ahhh i understand now. The more Gigs of RAM, the more that your phone apps DOES NOT restart! I get it now. I never really understood that but now I actually do."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I just got one,international model, brand new from Amazon, great phone!"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Great Review. I just bought this for my 81 year old mom. She just needs something basic. It's a great price.
6NBH0KLLe9s,I got this phone. It's awesome.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I'm surprised most people don't know these tips to speed up your android in 2024, but here are some ways to improve the A15 5g:

-Turn off animations via developer options, if you don't know how to Google it and follow the steps.

-Put any unused apps or rarely used apps into deep sleep mode and limit background processes in the settings menu.

-A basic thing most people overlook is regularly deleting cache on all apps and individual apps.  I'm not talking about just the cleaning tool to release memory in the settings menu.  You should tap on each app after using it and hit the app info interactive i with the circle around it then go to storage and cache then clear cache.  This is something you've always needed to do in every android phone no matter the processor or RAM to ensure the apps run well.  This is one of those common sense things that any android user should know and do but most people don't do this and it helps your device.

-If you've done the other things on this list the only other thing you can do to aid better performance is to wipe your cache partition.  Again, if you don't know how to Google it or look it up on a YouTube video.  

-One final tip is to regularly restart your phone.  This releases used memory and will help the phone to run at its peak performance.  You don't have to restart your phone every day but anywhere from once every couple days to a couple times per week is ideal.

I hope this helps anyone that experiences slow performance and you'd be surprised how doing these things helps even the most laggy phones."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thank you! I just got one for my DD ❤
6NBH0KLLe9s,The 90 Hz refresh rate can be turned on or off during the set up process but the phone warns you that if you do set it up it will drain the battery  faster
6NBH0KLLe9s,This Samsung Galaxy A15 5G Because I Love It ❤
6NBH0KLLe9s,3:57 According to Samsung this screen has the same tech they putted on the S23 : Vision Booster. And i love it.
6NBH0KLLe9s,I always love ur videos of tech smartphone reviews keep it up
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Been an apple fanboy my whole life, had every iphone up to the 14 pro max. Broke my pro max and didnt wanna spend a shit ton on a new one. Went and picked this phone up and absolutely love it. I won't be going back to apple."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I'm thinking about using my A15 as an iPod and Media Player. As well as a place to transfer my photos onto a portable photo device. Having an FM Tuner inside my headphone jack was a surprise and happy with it
6NBH0KLLe9s,It makes no sense they give you the charge cable but not the actual charger to hook it up with? What? Did I miss something? really?
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I do find it sluggish but my biggest beef with it is it doesn't play android auto on all the vehicles I drive. It just crashes, and the screen on the vehicle is frozen or just black.
If you have any advice on why it would be appreciated 👍"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thanks for making the review.
6NBH0KLLe9s,I have the prepaid version of the samsung a15 5g and it's been an extremely good phone so far.
6NBH0KLLe9s,this was a really in depth review and it is very informative thank you so much:)
6NBH0KLLe9s,Excellent review!
6NBH0KLLe9s,On 7:58 where did you buy that controller from?
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice it has headphone jack
6NBH0KLLe9s,Bro you really deserve more subs
6NBH0KLLe9s,"The other night the touch on my Pixel 6 started dying (it was long cracked, not sure what happened) so I drove to the store 30 mins before they closed and grabbed the 128GB/6GB/NFC/4G variant for $160 so I could still have a phone.  I'm shocked how good budget phones are now.  Sure, its marginally slower and has the occasional stutter, but really it does almost everything just as well. 

 My sole complaint is lack of stereo audio out the earpiece speaker. It seems like artificial market segmentation, because even a little bit from the earpiece speaker would be better than nothing."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I switched from iphone 12 Mini and I'm really happy. Great budget device
6NBH0KLLe9s,I just got mine yesterday ♥️
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Ive had mine for about a week and its a great phone for the price.Its not the best phone in the world,but it might be the best phone for $200 or less.I highly recommend it if your looking for a great phone at a great price"
6NBH0KLLe9s,This looks great in every area except performance. Crazy the mediatek dimensity 700 chip in the a13 and a14 5g was a more solid performing chipset. I can't help but think a more reliable snapdragon chip would've been much better.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Correction, there is video stabilization..."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I went to a phone store today to check out the 2024 Samsung Galaxy A15 5G.
I opened up six apps on the phone numerous times. I went back to the home screen and then to the close apps button. Each time I tapped on an open app it opened right up, it did not close.
I did this numerous times.
The phone that you are using must have a software issue."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I live in Germany and bought the Galaxy A55 with 128GB/8GB brand new for 330€ and for the price it is absolutely unbeatable
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thanks alot for this great video,it really helped.I've ordered mine should get it next week."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I came to this from an s21 ultra and tbh its totally fine for the price. Just reduce bloatware processes and turn off window animations.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"A brand new A15 G5 6GB International on ""sale"", you can find for $179 CAD / $130 USD. Same phone every day for $199 CAD / 145 US. It's good for what you get."
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not really major"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Excellent review.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thank you so much for this review of the Samsung A15 5G!  My gf and I both use very outdated phones, I still use my ORIGINAL LG Aristo, how old is that, lol!!!!  But I'm finding some apps will not work with my non-upgradeable operating system (Android 7)!  My gf also lives part of the year in Ecuador, part of the year here, and she needs an updated phone too!  So I just ordered two of these on Amazon, 256gb/8gb ram, for $179 each, one for me and one for her.  Big benefit for her is it's already unlocked, and dual sim slots means she can have her EC sim in one slot, her US sim in the other slot, either one ready to use whether she's here or there!  Am I right about that?  Thanks again for, in my mind, confirming my choice of this phone!"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Can you buy and use the international model in America?
UPDATE: I bought the international version of the phone and it is working with Verizon.  I bought the international version because the US version I saw for sale was $200 with the 4GB of ram and 128GB of storage and the international version I bought was $180 with 8GB of ram and 256GB of storage."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Awesome Video Thanks For This Video Bro.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Make a video about Samsung A35.. PLEASE .
6NBH0KLLe9s,Hey Shane great wee video as always I have used the Samsung Galaxy A13 I thought that it was a very good phone I'am currently using the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G phone it's better than the Samsung Galaxy A13 phone but I'am thinking about getting the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G some time real soon.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Unless you can get your hands on the international 8gb of ram, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE so many issues after a few months of use. I understand it's cheap but for 200 dollars I did not expect an unusable phone"
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Great review, I'm about to get one . Think it's good for the price."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Very informative review. We are considering switching from iphones to the Samsung A15 model (Or carrier offers it). Thanks!
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I just ordered one yesterday with Google Fi with a nice $100 off discount, shipping was free and upfront charge $0 down....total cost $99."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I like that Samsung has been passing the previous Gen specs down to the lower teir phone as I've found out thus is basically an A24, and also the A35 is basically an A54 ...."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Using the Samsung A15 along side my iPhone XS and I am content 😊
6NBH0KLLe9s,S24 ULTRA 3 months review please we need that 🙏
6NBH0KLLe9s,"This is 130€, where a iPhone 15 plus is 1119€, almost 10x as much. You can barely tell the difference, seriously. Both premium feel, with some shitty software and screen candy overdose messing up, except that Samsung/Google allows a bit more tweaking and sideloading and comes with a SD slot for near free storage updates and a mini-jack. I bet they roughly cost the same to manufacture, Apple can use slightly better quality components thanks to their production volume, but it is splitting hairs, so that means Apple gobbles up 800€ pure profit if you compare excl. VAT prices."
6NBH0KLLe9s,Do you have to use the fingerprint scanner or is there a place fornpasscode?
6NBH0KLLe9s,That was a nice little blade you used to open the box
6NBH0KLLe9s,I am absolutely living in Haiti this phone for me is the best one
6NBH0KLLe9s,"I still have my Samsung Galaxy M21 from 2020, dropped it in a puddle & it's still going strong lol. So I'm all for Samsung Galaxy phones. Thank you for reassuring me that upgrading to this model is a good idea, as a lot of the updated apps aren't compatible with android system 12 software & network changing to only 5g network."
6NBH0KLLe9s,I applaud Samsung for the Sd card and headphone jack
6NBH0KLLe9s,I'm going to get this phone soon and I know this is a stupid question but does this phone have a ear piece speaker above the front camera so you can hear the person on the other end of the call?
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Thank you for covering the screen brightness - an often overlooked feature in the vast majority of phone reviews. My job has me working outside and I have to make and receive work-related calls and texts. My current phone (Moto G22) is pitiful in the sunlight, and that's at maximum full brightness. This has been very helpful."
6NBH0KLLe9s,How exactly do you charge it with a C to C cord?  Sorry but I'm behind the times on this stuff.
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Like what mkbhd said: cheap phones are getting good,good phones are not getting cheap
this a15 is an example of a cheap phone,4yrs ago the a10s was pretty good now this a15 is real good i  will buy this when its at its lowest price"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Still looking forward to the updated review for the fit 3
6NBH0KLLe9s,The video are stable are you using a stand or with your hands or how did you make them that stable ?
6NBH0KLLe9s,I just ordered 2 of these phones. Thanks for the review...I had an old lg aristo 3 and it died. I don't even think they make phones anymore. Well I think this should be a big upgrade compared to that. I also got one for my son who is turning 18 for his bday. He has an older galaxy so I'm hoping these phone last awhile. Looks good from your review. 😊
6NBH0KLLe9s,"This has all the flagship features i need in a phone. 

Headphone jack & SD Card

May i ask if it has FM radio app on the phone? 

Btw if i am not wrong this is most selling samsung phone period! It sells in heaps in africa, india and certain parts of SEA"
6NBH0KLLe9s,Hello how long does the battery last? On the Samsung galaxy A15
6NBH0KLLe9s,Thank you . Does it have a head phone jack?
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice explain
6NBH0KLLe9s,Why no flashlight test -- brightness test and beam distance and beam shape
6NBH0KLLe9s,"My a20 5g dies so quick i needed this. Just got the yellow one for 127 plus tax 137! But 4g. Cant wait, comes in next Tuesday ill update everyone.👍"

6NBH0KLLe9s,What the name of the joypad acc that you use in this video to play games?
6NBH0KLLe9s,the cross apps does get annoying. does the samsung fe phones do that aswell??
6NBH0KLLe9s,Can you use a 35w adapter for the A15?
6NBH0KLLe9s,dont say youll do a real time test then make 5 edits it ruined any credibility in the test
6NBH0KLLe9s,I.own the Samsung A15 4G 128GB phone. Fir editing my travel photography on. I put a 512GB SD Card inside it.
6NBH0KLLe9s,Nice I'm going to buy one
6NBH0KLLe9s,"Anyone been using this have reliable performance? Im opting for a budget phone this year. I only will use spotify, android auto, snapseed and alarm/calling texting.
Is the alarm loud enough with the mono speaker? I will turn of animations and i dont give a blank about cameras, i ise a sony mirrorless."
6NBH0KLLe9s,wont those camera lenses get scratched over time?? or are they immune to scratches from day to day use...?
6NBH0KLLe9s,Not a bad phone for the price. Btw you're really cute 😍
6NBH0KLLe9s,Why is the power button finger print sensor button flat vs the volume buttons.  Drives me nuts
6NBH0KLLe9s,I got mine before yesterday
6NBH0KLLe9s,Might look into the a35. Play pokemon go and monster hunter now alot and the 4GB ram in my a14 5G starting to become a problem. Music apps i try to use at the same time keeps cutting out due to the games eating up all of the available ram 🐏
6NBH0KLLe9s,Why no mention that the edges are square now
6NBH0KLLe9s,This phone is not reliable. Try to make a call get not registered to a network. Have to restart to make a call or text. The fixes posted on YT don't work.
6NBH0KLLe9s,where u get the controller
