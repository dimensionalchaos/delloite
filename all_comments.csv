XaqOejIaFgM,I came back to this video now that I have finally converted from iphone 14 pro max to the S24 ultra. Not gonna lie this change was worth it. The phone is so stinking good. I'm loving it WAY more then ANY apple i've ever owned. I was apple since the 4.,2024-07-16T04:23:44Z,2024-07-16
XaqOejIaFgM,S24 Ultra look more PREMIUM than S25 Ultra...!,2025-02-24T12:35:23Z,2025-02-24
XaqOejIaFgM,"You basically just confirmed all the reasons I've been buying the Note and now the S Ultra series phones from Samsung. They're not cheap, but the amount of things on tap that are done either extremely well or well enough that it all adds up being worth the cost to me. Also, as an artist and someone who likes to handwrite, the SPen is incredibly useful and fun. No other phone even has this feature close to this level of refinement so I'd honestly buy the phone just for that if I had to.",2024-01-27T03:42:24Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,Absolute monster of a phone.  Mine just arrived mid-January.  Owned Samsung from almost the beginning of Smartphones.

XaqOejIaFgM,"Going back here after watching his video about the best phone of 2024. 
It comes full circle as mentioned in 0:28 that this phone sets the tone for 2024.

XaqOejIaFgM,Kudos to Samsung for getting rid of curved screen on their ultra model.  Samsung has cone a long way in terms of software.  I recall the touchwiz days. Literally had to flash custom rooms like Cyanogen mods. Only thing I miss from old phones are the removable batteries and expandable storage.,2024-01-27T00:19:50Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,I can spend 1300$ on an S24 and iPhone users would still call me broke for preferring an Android.,2024-07-08T20:33:51Z,2024-07-08

XaqOejIaFgM,"I've had the S8 forever and last night my phone's charging port finally gave up. I got it fixed, but because I was eligible for an upgrade, I bought an S24 Ultra today, largely due to how you meticulously broke down the phone's specs and because of your glowing review. Thanks for the thorough review!",2024-03-31T06:37:59Z,2024-03-31

XaqOejIaFgM,Worth the wait. I hate that other tech reviewers rushed their so called ‚Äúreview‚Äù just for the views while taking advantage of the buzz created by Samsung. I like that MKBHD took his time to give us real and quality ‚Äúreview‚Äù. There‚Äôs levels to this and I can say MKBHD is at the top.,2024-01-26T23:26:48Z,2024-01-26

XaqOejIaFgM,"I went from a S10 to the S22 ultra. I've had the S22 for two years and it is still the best phone I have ever experienced. I'll be upgrading to the S24 ultra this year partly because of this review. I TRUST your reviews and I know you're going to be honest, good or bad. Thank you!!",2024-01-26T23:23:52Z,2024-01-26

XaqOejIaFgM,The whole live translation thing is honestly the most impressive bit of technology ive seen in a long time and i love the tech world. Having my phone be able to live translate a conversation im having was something i dreamed of as a kid and saw in spy movies and shows. Crazy that it was just a feature added to galaxy phones with the most recent software update,2024-06-01T01:56:17Z,2024-06-01

XaqOejIaFgM,Just managed to upgrade to s24 ultra today. Glad I made the right decision üòÇ,2025-03-19T18:58:36Z,2025-03-19
XaqOejIaFgM,One note: the save as sticker feature in Samsung gallery has been available on older phones. I have a galaxy S22 and I've got that feature.,2024-01-27T11:39:33Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"7 years with updates! Well done Samsung! üëè Phones are so good and expensive now, that it makes sence giving the buyer a reassuring feeling.",2024-01-30T20:05:25Z,2024-01-30
XaqOejIaFgM,"I have s24 ultra and iphone 15 pro, and I noticed I like using s24 ultra more, the screen is so great for watching videos and reading ebooks, and the new AR coating is fantastic, it feels like reading a ereader.",2024-05-02T17:11:02Z,2024-05-02
XaqOejIaFgM,"Update on the S24 Ultra vs S25 Ultra

S24 Ultra
- Box Style shape (Just like the original note series)
- S24 Ultra first flat screen with eligant curved frame gives premium style (Flat screen protector frienldy)
- Brightness was tested as ive seen and notice is brighter. (Coating or what not probably causing this but the anti reflection is nearly identical)
- S-Pen bluetooth (Gimick or useful but still very nice knowing you have some inspector gadget type tech in your pocket if needed)
- One UI 7 Update for the S24U has some new video exporting blowing away the non optimized version of the S25 U as seen and tested.
- Camera rings are solid and premium (Flush no potential removal)
- 7 years of update (S24U) and was originally advertised as the AI phone already (I use all the AI features Minus the Now brief on the S25 Ultra i had it turned off)
- S-pen location on the S24 Ultra is in a perfect spot for cases (S25 Ultra seems to have it in a odd location where its curved so all the cases have a nasty open cutout in the corner)

S25 Ultra
- Feels like an Iphone which i always envyed iphone users having a flat square display but the samsung design lost its touch reminds me of the redmagic phone (not Note shape)
- Faster CPU but samsung is behind updating a more optimized version for the S25 Ultra
- Nearly only one year extra of uptades vs the S24 U 
- Extra pixels in one camera (I dont see the difference)
- Blue tooth 5.4 vs 5.3 (Dont notice much maybe the 6.0 will be a bigger upgrade.


Conclusion:
Sending my S25 Ultra back and will continue to use the S24 Ultra (I will snag a new one when they come back to the Note roots i have  under 7 years not in a hurry but ill cross my fingers on this one)",2025-06-07T02:53:00Z,2025-06-07
XaqOejIaFgM,"One thing I noticed is the battery management is absolutely amazing. Where I would run out 15% of my battery, I now run 1-2% max, it's actually insane...
Yes my S21 Ultra was getting old and I used it A LOT, so the battery would have been losing efficiency. But my god, that's 7x+ on the top end, I don't think i've ever had that experience when i've upgraded, and i've gone
S2 > S4 > S7 Edge > S9 Plus > S21 Ultra > Now this.
Not a single one of those upgrades gave me this battery efficiency.",2024-06-01T19:20:57Z,2024-06-01
XaqOejIaFgM,"Thank you for this review, even though I can argue that many people actually like smaller phones at the end of the day.
I have tested the smaller S24 on my channel running the new Exynos, Temps, and Battery drain, and I dare to say that even the base variants this year is impressive, Feel free to check out the numbers for yourself.",2024-01-27T03:47:08Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,Was about to pre order the iphone 16 pro max (Had a iphone 15 pro max) watched all the videos on it saw there was minor additions. Started looking into the samsung 24 ultra immediatly bought it. Sold my 15 pro max and my Mac Mini (8gbram  256 storage) at a local mac reseller store for 1300$ cash ordered my samsung online for 999.99 took the profit got a portable monitor 4k 120hz 15.6 in and a full size bluetooth keyboard for Dex. NEVER turning back !,2024-09-14T12:31:19Z,2024-09-14

XaqOejIaFgM,moving the car in the photo blew my mind. and that fill in the space. wow!,2024-01-27T15:45:26Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"I am a Pixel 8 Pro user and when S24 dropped and I saw all the AI features,  the first thing I felt was as if this was a Pixel phone on a Samsung Hardware. I was surprised that nobody really mentioned about in the first impression videos! Happy to know that you felt it. Would love to see a video on how Google and Samsung is coming together. Throwback to the Nexus days!",2024-01-27T12:40:34Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"I'm glad I got the s24 ultra, the s25 ultra losing Bluetooth, not upgrading to a 1 inch sensor for the main cam, not upgrading the 3x telephoto and just the ultrawide lol Samsung got really greedy. if this is the direction Samsung is going, this could be my last Samsung phone the s24 ultra.",2025-01-29T04:28:28Z,2025-01-29

XaqOejIaFgM,"I've had the S22 Ultra since a few months after it came out, and it's still going strong, but I'm actually compelled to get the 24. One of my favorite things about my S22 Ultra is the zoom on it. I actually just use the view finder like binoculars all the time because the zoom is so insane and stable.
I really thought I could hold off on an upgrade for longer than this, but the S24 Ultra is just so much better, and the flat screen just makes it perfect",2024-02-20T07:13:39Z,2024-02-20
XaqOejIaFgM,The software support and 1TB are my main reasons to get this phone for under $600 with my trade-in.,2024-01-26T21:56:40Z,2024-01-26

XaqOejIaFgM,Got the base S24 two days ago (I had a S20FE before) and am having fun with all the features. The AI autocorrection is especially helpful to me as a non-native English speaker (the feature is also used for this text). And those seven years of updates are tempting.,2024-01-26T22:40:05Z,2024-01-26

XaqOejIaFgM,"Just waiting on mine to arrive at Feb 7. I knew this phone was going to be a monster. The new 5x, the 4k120, the 8k on the 5x, the 2600 peak brightness and anti reflective screen makes it easier to shoot outdoors. And also not to mention the shutter lag finally it's gone!! Can't wait!!",2024-01-27T04:24:40Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"I got mine on Friday and was worried I'd have buyers remorse, but so far I'm so impressed with it. It's very snappy and honestly fun to use.",2024-01-28T18:18:14Z,2024-01-28
XaqOejIaFgM,"Very interesting to see that Google and Samsung are collaborating like crazy to build up an unified Android empire to compete with Apple. At this point we might as well call them the Android S24 Ultra, and Android 8 Pro üòÇ",2024-01-27T01:45:21Z,2024-01-27

XaqOejIaFgM,"It's not often I get to use the same device Marques drops a review on. Got my S24U couple of days back and the other alternative I considered was Pixel 8 pro. I loved the fact that Google and Samsung joined hands on this, especially at the AI on edge computing paradigm we are embarking on now. Phone is incredible, love that the AI features are not in your face but just there. Integrated as if they were always there. Great video as usual and ya, that video on Google+Samsung against the world is worth exploring. And I think this collaboration could go beyond phones as well, like Google TV on Samsung TVs.",2024-01-27T05:12:00Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,"My S24 ultra arrived this week, the AI generative fill on photos is insane! I keep trying photos and removing people/objects and it blows my mind each time, even difficult photos where I don't expect it to work, and it does it. Super impressive.",2024-01-27T00:28:49Z,2024-01-27
XaqOejIaFgM,The synergy between Google and Samsung is welcome and will make things better for every android consumer. The one thing I would like to see is feature drops on Samsungs like Google does with the Pixels and give more attention to older models. The S23 getting these AI features is a step in the right direction. Another thing everyone seems to overlook about Pixels is that their purpose is also to push other manufacturers to make their OS experience better and simpler for their users. I think this is evident with Samsung's recent One UI updates.,2024-01-27T07:36:35Z,2024-01-27

XaqOejIaFgM,"I ordered the S24+ and am very excited for it. Hobestly price aside, the only things I like more about the Ultra is the 5x telephoto, and the much better Gorilla Glass (anti reflective, and very scratch resistant). Otherwise I'm very excited for the S24+, and prefer the slightly smaller size with rounded corners.",2024-01-26T21:51:45Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,Finally back to flat displays. I never liked the curved screens that had inconsistent viewing experiences near the edge. Also THANK YOU SAMSUNG for adding a good anti reflective coating. Most underrated feature.,2024-01-26T21:51:21Z,2024-01-26
XaqOejIaFgM,"I got it immediately; after waiting years from the note not being available, to this ""ultra"" being a significantly more expensive upgrade and skipping ANOTHER year, finally pulled the trigger and I effing love it. Black, but all the colors are sweet.",2024-02-15T00:35:31Z,2024-02-15

I'm a SMARTPHONE user so I want the best screen (dpi/brightness/anti-glare), best battery, best/most usablility and productivity options, best gaming- and multi-media experience, best personalization options and best innovation. 
I want DEX, KNOX, S-PEN, call recording, multi-tasking, multi-window, fingerprint scanner, best screen, widgets, themes, integration with windows, the biggest eco-system (Samsung SmartThings), fast charging, fast wireless charging, SEVEN YEARS OF UPDATES and I want AI.

K-JGaqfIOmI,"Sorry, but may it be that you confused the namings left / right on the photo comparison? Because everything you said regarding where the s24 was better, felt like  you were talking about the right part of the picture, because it is more defined, more detail, more texture, better dyncamic range... check out the 5x vs 3x at 07:21 for example. Or the night-scene at 06:24. the right part (""s23"") looks better to my eyes, noticeably! It would also be helpful, if you sometimes mark something in those shots with a pen, so watcher can see a hint which example / detail you mean in the picture. At 6:21 -> check out the wall wwhere the 3 little trees are in front. The Right picutre is way more defined / detailed / lit up! Or look at the bricks  texture at the building... obvious!

K-JGaqfIOmI,I understand their an update fix for the Vivid setting to obviously be more VIVID .Remember the screen has the Anti Glare effect so the screen is appears darker. That would be effected by a screen protector. The Anti Glare feature appears to be forgotten by Samsung wich it ironically is not promoted???ü§îNote to future proof your phone  if possible get the 512gb  or 1Terebyte Version. This will increase the resale value. Plus add a motivation for buying. I am using the S22 Ultra 512 version. At the time the seller upgraded to the S23 Ultra and was moving to each new iteration as part of his job. So I got the S22 Ultra a year ago on Ebay for $430 What a surprise.

I really don't get it, people shooting ""Pro"" often want to have a more flat picture, with less contrast and less saturation, but Pro people don't use 4k ?

Ôªø
ÔªøI have noticed that the frame around the 50MP periscope telephoto camera on my phone is slightly tilted, approximately 5-7 degrees off from the vertical or relative to the phone's vertical edge. This seems like it could be an assembly issue during production.

K-JGaqfIOmI,"I love Android, especially Samsung. I've been considering getting a new phone, but there's a complete deal breaker for me: I've never been able to get voice commands to work using the Gboard keyboard. Since I dislike the other keyboards available on Android, I don't really have a solution.

I've always stuck with iPhone because of this issue. The voice command on iPhone may not be the best‚Äîneither as fast nor as effective as on Android‚Äîbut at least it works.

If anyone has a solution that works, I'd be ready to switch back to Android, because the Galaxy S24 Ultra is really tempting me.

The only Android phone where I find that voice commands work right out of the box is on Google's Pixels. The problem is that I don't necessarily want a Pixel; I generally prefer Samsung, especially their high-end models.

It not only allows me to write much faster to many different people, but I am also disabled, so it's much less exhausting for me to speak than to type long texts by hand",2024-05-10T18:17:06Z,2024-05-10

z598clQ71JY,"At 58, I went from the cheapest phones from Tracphone for a 2 week road trip for emergencies, to my last was Samsung A53 5G, to the one I got Wednesday, the unlocked Samsung S24 Ultra.  I went from the 19th century to the 23rd with this jump in tech.  Since I got I have been playing with it to remove all the crap and turn off all the background stuff and make sure it is set right.  THANKS for the tips.   At 68, I am amazed at the capabilities of a hand held device.  I grew up with the original Star Trek and the Doctors hand held device is here!     I'm happy I can still be amazed at the new tech.",2025-01-25T19:35:50Z,2025-01-25
z598clQ71JY,"Nice. I'll likely move back to Samsung in 2025 for the S25 Ultra. 

My iPhone 15 Pro battery isn't kicking it for me. I also miss the Samsung ecosystem; especially the S-Pen, which I use a lot.",2024-07-29T16:23:21Z,2024-07-29
z598clQ71JY,"Fyi the goodlock update was pushed out about a month ago, at least for my unlocked u.s. version. One other thing as to the s pen, NOBODY ever mentions its website usage. It's why i find the s pen so useful. For small hyperlinks, forms, and maps. Furthermore i need extremely precise map coordinates for search & rescue as well as noaa maps, and the s pen does what a finger cannot.

z598clQ71JY,"Something everyone misses about screen saturation on the S24s is that by default the saturation slider is set to the lowest. Go into settings>display>adaptive colour tone and turn it off. Then go into screen mode, select ""vivid"" then the ""advanced settings"" button. You will get a 3 step slider. By default it is set to the lowest. I have mine in the middle. But if you like the old samsung overly saturated look, you can get it by sliding it to the max. The screen is amazing either way. And then you CAN turn adaptive colour tone back on.",2024-09-24T04:17:01Z,2024-09-24

z598clQ71JY,I got used to the S Pen on my small Note20 so I bought the S24Ultra to continue to enjoy the advantages. The S Pen is much more precise in choosing things on the screen (like the tiny 'X's to close annoying overlay ads).

Yes, the price is still pretty big, but probably before Black Friday or on BF will be at an more resonable price i hope. I want to switch from an iPhone 13(not pro, the simple one) to S24U and i‚Äôm convinced that the camera is not that spectaular how many many youtubers said‚Ä¶but you get the job done with it‚Ä¶at least is a flagship phone‚Ä¶

z598clQ71JY,"I keep going back to my S24U opposed to my P8. After using standard Galaxy or the ""Plus"" verisons from S8-S10 era's, I figured I drop my S21 for the premium S24U. This thing is so good when it comes to shooting concert shots, fast / responsive interface, battery, cooling, customization, display. I will try out my P8 every other month or in special use cases when not wanting to lug around a larger phone. I find the software fun with the haptics and animations on the P8, but the S24U always feels like home. 

I hope Samsung one day can bring the flagship Ultra into a smaller, rounded corner variation like Google is doing with the P9 Pro. I'm VERY interested.",2024-07-29T14:38:03Z,2024-07-29

Especially the terrible yellow haunting situation occurs when filming videos at the 5x camera. You can fix Whit Balance by pro mode but in this mode you cannot be switched between cameras. It's so stupid. They even removed the feature of recording portrait videos 3x optical in the previously existing on the S23U.",2024-07-28T02:07:51Z,2024-07-28

z598clQ71JY,"I agree very much with this review about it being worth it or not. I'd like to get the S24+ instead, but it comes with Exynos in my region (Brazil). Only the S24U comes with Snapdragon 8 Gen3 here.

The alternative would be the much more well priced S23+, but August 2nd is my b-day and I wanted to splurge on a top tier smartphone to swap my Galaxy A51 for and keep it for years.",2024-07-28T01:47:46Z,2024-07-28

z598clQ71JY,"I upgraded from an S22 Ultra to an S24 Ultra 2 days ago, and honestly, the experience is almost identical. The main reasons I upgraded are that my old phone had some scratches on the front screen and bezel, and I also wanted 7 years of software support. The S22 Ultra is only good for 3 Android version updates, and next year would be its last one. It will receive security patches for a while, but after Android 15, there will be no more official versions for it.

I'm hoping to keep this one for a long time. Prior to the S21 Ultra 5G (Exynos) and S22 Ultra (Snapdragon), I had my S7 for over 5 years. Now that everything just feels like an incremental upgrade, I think that I will stay put.",2024-12-19T02:38:45Z,2024-12-19
z598clQ71JY,"I have purchased Samsung phones exclusively since cell phones came on the scene. My current phone is the Z Fold 4; however, that phone became virtually unusable when it suffered from what I understand is a not so uncommon problem: when I fold and close the phone (from its very impressive full screen) it shuts off. I mean, it powers down completely and the only way to access the phone is to turn it on and go through the power-on protocol. This means, I now must use my phone as a tablet, unless I am willing to go through the 2-3 minute power-on process each time I close the phone. I am passed warranty and repairs here in Mexico are somewhat problematic AND, how can you not have your phone for the days required for it to be repaired, a cost, I have been told, also appears to be steep... So, I have decided to switch from the foldable phones (which are beautiful) and I've ordered the S24 Ultra. I do hope the transition to a small screen won't be too much of a disappointment. Then again--to not have your phone work is a pretty serious disappointment in itself.    Thank you for the fair assessment of the S24 Ultra. By the way (oh, can yammer so) I have extensive high-quality photography gear. That said, the convenience of have my always-available phone/camera has allowed me to take innumerable high-quality photographs I would not have had were it not for my phone. The photos I have taken with my Samsung phones, given the nature of the equipment, have been and continue to be superb. I do run them through Snapseed software, and, again, given the nature of the equipment, I couldn't be happier. ... Thanks for allowing me space to ramble.",2024-09-07T21:12:20Z,2024-09-07

umJbhJRe67I,"I've owned mine for what feels like  6 months. This is not a working mans phone. There's not much improvement over the note 10 which isn't surprising since that phone was excellent. 
 The S24 ultra is for people who live for their phone. It's extremely fiddly and the AI is extremely suspicious. EG i looked up the calender for a date Tuesday the 26th...gee the twenty six is actually Monday gd it. The audio alert volume was lowered yesterday...today it back. Also it needs q specific case because how it's held is extremely important and it needs to still charge wirelessly. All the while it still has a crappy spell ck and it l9ves commas more than anything...to a fault. Also it's the most inconsistent phone I've ever owned. Some times the touch screen doesn't snap to it while other times I'm a half inch from the screen and it responds. Even the simple thing are not yet available such as a choice of 3 rows of word suggestions instead of numbers and emojis  rows.
 I can't stress enough how fiddly it is. It's me vs how i need my phone to behave challenge. 
 Not more than a decade ago sony started a campaign that changes the wording of instructions that made them vague. The s24ultra is similar but instead of vague it different aka there's a better way to state it. Also it has its share of wokeness. 
 Finally, I was looking at photos on a friends phone that wasn't a Samsung and they looked noticeably more clear and vibrant. Imho. Also why can't it use gps when there isn't any towers nearby? Why does the map get covered with unwanted crap when using Google maps and that stupid spin feature has never gone away since day one. I understand that it on Google but still...and how about streaming music in the car with ""downloaded "" music only for it to drop dead the moment there isn't a signal. Why isn't there a back button? They're  fkn delete buttons? There're different sorts of delete buttons!

nyxcO2vdcCg,"I just got my s24 ultra yesterday. And the screen clarity on this thing is absolutely insane. I have had a note series phone since the two and the 10 plus I had for 4 years and actually love that phone. I only upgraded to the fold4 last year after they killed off the note series and I wanted to get the newest 5G capabilities and not just the ultra wide 5G that the Note 10 plus 5G came with. But I found myself using the front small screen more often than taking the time to open up the phone to use it and really only used it to watch movies or shows. And since the ultra line took back where the note left that big gaping hole in the Samsung lineup I decided to jump back and get the 24 ultra. Where with trading in my fold4, getting a pre-order discount, and another $150 off coupon on top of it, and the 512 GB matching for the same price as the 256, I got mine delivered for just a hair over $700. It also came with case and screen protector and I got the Samsung buds pro 2 for free with it as well. So all in all not a bad deal for all that for that price.",2024-01-30T18:25:33Z,2024-01-30

xr8CpY3tM8U,"Be cool if you were to show us your task  launcher and prove that you don‚Äôt have the apps already loaded on the s24u vs iPhone 15PM launching from a cold start - I‚Äôve got both phones and will do the same test this evening. Film it too - as well, I can show you identical apps (X-Plane & Aerofly FS World), very taxing amps with user control over graphic performance - where the s24 ultra can‚Äôt maintain 30fps (dropping as low as 12-14fps in populated areas and/or cockpit controls) - while the iPhone, same settings, doesn‚Äôt drop below 57-58fps, regardless of the terrain or the drawing of instrumentation and real time mapping on a glass cockpit. Even has a difficult time with steam gauge SuperCubs and 15/172s! 

I love both for different reasons, and I can show you the fact the S24 Ultra will NOT allow the use of Google Drive and/or Photos as a default repository for media or backing up your phone. The ONLY option is OneDrive! I‚Äôve owned every iPhone since 2007, and along with them, I purchased an Android phone - initially, Notes 1, 2, 4, & 5 - I switched to Pixels, back to Sammy, and took a couple year break, until the S21/iPhone 11. This, even though the 11‚Äôs had the power and efficiency in the chip, the 21 was a better choice in my opinion. That opinion changed with 12 - 15 (I have 15PM and 24u, no 16/25) and the ridiculous redundancy of EVERY mandatory smartphone app; calendars, phones, messaging, notes, wallets, stores, calculators, voice recorders, contacts, clocks, ‚Äòinternet‚Äô, reminders, find my apps, and I‚Äôve likely forgotten a dozen - but the ones I named ALL have the option to use the Samsung or Google version of the keyboard (one I forgot) as the default keyboard 
Unfortunately, and as ubiquitous as Google Drive/Photos (2 apps Mt View hasn‚Äôt abandoned) have been the last decade, as well as they‚Äôve worked cross platform - whether WIndows or macOS, iOS, Android or iPadOS, Drive and Photos are arguably as good or better file managers than others‚Äô native apps. Like Sammy‚Äôs Gallery! Who‚Äôs EVER used it other than Samsung SXX users? Or Galaxy tabs or laptops? Those are the ONLY three things capable of accessing your Samsung Gallery
EVERY other Android phone or tablet - including Samsung, has allowed Google Photos as your repository for stills and motion, Drive for audio and docs spreadsheets etc. No longer.

NOW if you want your pictures backed up you HAVE to have a subscription for MS365, which includes OneDrive, the ONLY option for photo backup (& video and everything else on your phone) able to be used other than a local SSD, same that you can do on iPhone - however, I can choose Chrome as my default browser on iPhone - Google Maps as my default mapping app, or G-Mail, Drive, Photos, everything is an option on Apple‚Äôs products.

The fact Samsung has 
A) dropped support for Photos and
B) done the same with Drive is over the top, and IMO, a purchase killer. Period

As a subscriber already of MS365 pre-s24u purchase, I‚Äôd have returned it, as you‚Äôre looking at an extra $120 a year to store your photos in the cloud, instead of the tiers of Google storage sizes.
This is my biggest complaint about the Samsung phones but followed closely by a few dozen redundant apps that Samsung copies Google‚Äôs and other‚Äôs to use open code software as a foundation for ONE UI, the crappiest OS on mobile in existence. Even though G-Board eats storage, the Samsung keyboard‚Äôs a joke.

I will say, the ONLY two things I‚Äôve found preferable on the s24U vs the iPhone are the display (but ‚Äòjust‚Äô as both are stellar) and the lack of almost ANY software I use 90% of the time on iOS and iPadOS - from incredible cameras for both stills and video, Timelapse and celestial - Play Store options are a joke in comparison‚Ä¶ and audio production; from Digital Audio Workstations AKA DAWs to synths, percussion, wave editing and simple recording apps with multitrack abilities that are essential for prosecution. 
Why a positive? I don‚Äôt  have to buy them again!
Display, a slight edge, otherwise, I guess - and I‚Äôve tried, I‚Äôm not a phone customizer guy. The themes and goofy fonts, the single colors or gradients, and the need to feel unique or different doesn‚Äôt appeal to me at all, and wile the ultrasonic finger print reader is amazing, it also sucks trying to land it correctly first try‚Ä¶ where is the iPhone or iPad w/Face ID work instantly, battery life are near parity, my 15PM might have a slight edge, especially if gaming. And Microsoft and Adobe have MUCH better performance and capability, as well as apps - period - on iOS. While Docs and Sheets work okay, they don‚Äôt compare to the MS Suite, not even Apple‚Äôs Office suite - and messaging? What a S&%T Show! 
iMessage is so far ahead of either Goog or Sam‚Äôs messaging - and anyone older than 30‚Äôs not ‚ÄòSnapping‚Äô - and unless you‚Äôre a fan of illegal communication, Signal and the rest don‚Äôt hold a candle to iMessage‚Äôs continuity with all Apple products one has; Macs, iPads, Apple Watches, Car Play, Home Pods, Air Pods, vertical and horizontal integration is definitely a massive plus, even though Samsung‚Äôs doing their best to jump in the sack with Windows, using connect to Windows, OneDrive as only option to backup - they‚Äôd be better off developing, from scratch, without the 30 years of x86 cruft built on cruft so you can still run that ‚Äòlegacy‚Äô software that‚Äôs not been updated since last millennium - Samsung could easily take a couple years to write a decent third OS, without the Android Open Source code or the foundation of Windows 11‚Äôs nightmares‚Ä¶ instead building better continuity between ALL devices - opening their market up significantly (and giving their customers back a dozen gigs of memory while eliminating the Google apps you can‚Äôt use!)",2025-04-03T01:20:34Z,2025-04-03

I got to hold the S25 ultra at the store today and just, eugh, this will unfortunately be a deal breaker for me. It's not just light it's drastically lighter than any larger smartphone, giving it an unappealing hollowness to it. Maybe some people will like it, but 218 grams for a 6.9 in phone is insane. That's lighter than the iPhone 16 Plus which is already considered to be very light!

TGWvTWtlvZo,I have the s24 ultra and the s25 ultra. Besides the 8 gen 3 processor and the camera specs vs the s25 ultra its the best phone. The processor and camera is still fast and good. One ui 7 enhanced it and the s24 ultra is a straight demon üòà.,2025-04-23T18:10:49Z,2025-04-23

I recently purchased the s25 ultra after having problems with the 15 pro Max which may not be much of an upgrade but I wanted a phone that would last me for at least the next 5 years if necessary and this gets the job done. I really considered the s24 ultra but was afraid of possibly inheritance someone else's glitch although that's even possible with a new phone. I have no regrets about getting the s25 ultra but yes, I would highly recommend s24 ultra if somebody wanted to save just a little bit of money and still pretty much get everything that I have.

L-GvP1umbfM,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra outshines the iPhone 16 Pro Max in several key areas. First, the Galaxy S24 Ultra boasts a more advanced camera system. It features a 200-megapixel main sensor that provides unparalleled clarity and detail in photos, surpassing the iPhone's 48-megapixel main camera. Additionally, the Ultra's camera includes enhanced AI capabilities that significantly improve low-light photography and video stabilization, making it ideal for capturing high-quality content in any lighting condition.

Another significant advantage is the Galaxy S24 Ultra's battery life and charging technology. It comes equipped with a 5000mAh battery, which lasts longer than the iPhone 16 Pro Max's 4323mAh battery. Moreover, the Ultra supports super-fast charging, allowing you to charge up to 50% in just about 20 minutes. This is a considerable improvement over the iPhone, which charges more slowly. These features make the Galaxy S24 Ultra a more practical choice for users who need a powerful device that can keep up with their busy lifestyles.",2025-01-03T21:10:16Z,2025-01-03

ITJVzQXIUco,"I also have very bad OCD when it comes to my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, Playstation 5 Slim and Playstation 5 Pro, my 43"" Samsung Crystal 4K UHD 60hz TU7000 TV, and many more of my prized possessions. I definitely feel you on those tiny scuffs being something that triggers your OCD because this is exactly how I feel when any of my prized possessions take any type of physical damage whatsoever, even if its so minor that you have to zoom in or look incredibly close to see it. It's cool to know im not alone with this kind of stuff. Those minor scuffs on the corners od your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra would most definitely trigger my OCD. This is why I make sure to use a Tech 21 Evo Clear Case and Zagg Invisible Shield XTR2 Eco Curve Screen Protector. I never take my phone out of the case or take off my screen protector unless it's time to replace it.",2025-05-22T08:56:03Z,2025-05-22

I was an iPhone user for some years before this Samsung and probably only things that i didn't like was some apps oprimization, especially facebook, is pretty annoing and have a lot of bugs. But over all is a solid phone, is not the best, but is a veeery good all rounder and the cameras are good, not gbe greatest in industry, but if you get used to it and know how to use it at full potential, you can take very good shots, especially with zoom lensüòÅ",2025-03-20T21:12:01Z,2025-03-20

ITJVzQXIUco,"If they'd change SW photo over-processing (video and front faced are great) and added battery >5000mah with faster charging - it would be my primary phone. Now I use Xiaomi 13 Pro more often since I take a lot of photos in nature and can't always drag my DSLR along. Shame because on 25 they removed BT from pen and I do use that as remote for camera when Samsung is on stand, so I'll skip 25 altogether.

Bottom line, amazing all rounder, one of the best for that, but if you're a niche user, especially for photography, there are better options out there.",2025-01-31T10:09:56Z,2025-01-31

ITJVzQXIUco,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is one of my favorite smartphones of all time. However, I actually prefer the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra more for their better design, curved display, more premium looking Armor Aluminum build, and 10mp 10x optical telephoto cameras. Since all of the recent Samsung Galaxy S Ultra Series smartphones have basically the same specs, features, capabilities, and software, it mostly comes down to which design looks better to me. My top 5 favorite smartphones of all time in order based on their design and specs are the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.",2025-05-19T14:04:38Z,2025-05-19

With that said, Apple should just allow users to go to 100x with a button or slider within the camera app like Samsung.

The marginal difference in picture quality does not justify the price tag of Samsung.

About durability, I am still using Oneplus 6T for more than 5 years now and it still has no issues whatsoever.
SD845 still performs superbly fast (for gaming as well).

But side by side the 12 is way brighter and more vibrant. The OnePlus 12 battery last a long time. I charged both phones at 7am and have 20 percent at 11 am at night without charging once.  The 12 charges faster , but s24 Ultra charges in full at about 1 hr and 12 min , it seems to charge faster at times. 12 charges at full in 30 sometimes 35 . But something about the 12 in the green is beautiful to look at. But unfortunately very slippery, so I'm using a full body case on both. The 12 has some crazy features. Allowing you to take storage and add to ram among other stuff. I still think the company OnePlus beats everyone even Samsung. Just the price and what you get. But the Samsung AI is interesting.

ITsMdoaoDPk,I have always had a Samsung last 15 years. I will  go to the 24 ultra for the anti glare and larger screen. As  I get older my eyes need bigger.

Definitely going to miss the rear fingerprint scanner, aux port, RGB notification lights, and expandable storage. Hope the S24 can last to 7 years like you mentioned.",2024-01-27T04:44:51Z,2024-01-27

ITsMdoaoDPk,I really appreciate your comparison of these devices. I've had phablet sized devices for 14 years starting with the Dell Streak back in 2010 and I DO love the screen real estate but currently I am starting to tire of it a tiny bit. Big phones are cool but I kind of want to go back to basics with a smaller device. I am worried tthe smaller battery on the S24 is a problem and I've had my eyes on the Plus but you've reassured me. I definitely want to take it for a spin. Thank you Mike.,2024-03-04T16:29:26Z,2024-03-04
ITsMdoaoDPk,"I loved the S23 Ultra, but the impractical design of Ultras pushed me to the S24+ this year.
The sharp edges and annoying weight of Ultras are not great. In my experience, the Plus is about as big and heavy as a phone can be while still being comfortable to hold in one hand for any significant period of time.
Aluminum makes more sense than titanium because weight matters a lot in a phone. The lighter a phone is, the less likely you are to drop it, which negates the utility of stronger/heavier materials.",2024-02-23T14:20:23Z,2024-02-23

ITsMdoaoDPk,"I got my S24+ in Seoul, and so I got the ARMv8. :)
This thing is an absolute beast. Nothing slows it down.
But be warned, the first few days you have an S24, you will think that maybe you got a defective product, because the phone gets so hot at random times. I was quite worried the 3rd or 4th time I picked it up, and it was like it has been sitting in the sun, baking for 10 minutes. Like worryingly hot.
And then it simply stopped happening!
 I later learned this is the Samsung AI power and thermal management software learning and adjusting itself automatically to the way you use your phone. :)",2024-05-23T05:34:31Z,2024-05-23
ITsMdoaoDPk,"Great video.  I've got the 24+ on order.  Got into the special pre-order thingy 2 hours before it was over, had to make a choice w/o seeing the phones.

ITsMdoaoDPk,"It's a surprising conclusion. üòÖ With the S24 lacking some of the features (like finding a smart tag easily) and starting only at 128GB, perhaps people who really like smaller screens will find it appealing. For most people, the S24 Plus seems to be a better choice. The price difference is not that significant when both phones have 256GB.",2024-01-26T23:35:51Z,2024-01-26
ITsMdoaoDPk,"I was really interested to hear that the S24, S24 Plus and S24 Ultra all get similar battery life from your tests. The main consideration for me with buying the S24 Plus over the S24 would be that it has a bigger battery, but I guess that doesn't matter as much as I thought it did.

Plus on Samsung's website I'm getting $200 trade in value (most places I'm lucky to get $40).  I have small hands so the big old phones (Pluses and Ultras) don't matter to me, nor does the intricate camera/video features.

ITsMdoaoDPk,"Very well balanced, clear & informative review, thanks very much. Very disappointed to hear that Galaxy AI is only free until the end of 2025 though, seems a bit misleading of Samsung considering this was a key selling point of the new S series phones!!!",2024-01-27T17:02:35Z,2024-01-27
ITsMdoaoDPk,"Idk why Samsung likes to nip at the heels of the base S model so much. It seems like year after year it's slowly just becoming a worse phone comparatively just to upsell the more expensive models. Like why would you ever omit the ultrawide band? The S series should be the flagships, there shouldn't be such a discrepancy between them. I also feel like the S24 base could have like 200-400 mAh more than it currently does as well as faster charging. None of these are particularly dealbreakers, but it's annoying to see on Samsung's side where iPhone treats the Pro roughly the same as the Pro Max, although recently that's changed too. Just annoying to have to roll my eyes so much at the small things they take away from the base model just to upsell you to the more expensive ones. I doubt it'll get any better, either.",2024-01-27T07:03:51Z,2024-01-27

My co worker who has the ultra 24 says its not worth it and he regrets getting it and that he couldnt feel a difference to the regular s24+

ITsMdoaoDPk,"People that are smart are the ones who dont fall for these money making schemes with these smartphone companies. 
The cost of living is already overwealming considering inflation. 
Ask yourself if it makes sense to you to really spend over $1000 on a cellphone? For what? 
To take better pictures? 
To browse the internet?
Just to play higher quality games? 
Nah, I have a decent laptop and tablet at home already doing that. üòÇ .... besides, I need a new washing machine, microwave and a new stove. 
$1300 on such a small gadget is a waste of money. Especially when dropped and smashed, stolen or lost. I hope the same $1300 price also insures the phone to be replaced. Likely *NOT* ... so it is indeed a waste of money",2024-11-13T21:28:58Z,2024-11-13

Keep up the great videos!",2024-01-26T20:38:39Z,2024-01-26
ITsMdoaoDPk,I pre-ordered the plus as well based on so many reviewers :( base model is perfect small phone size except for the small 8gb/256 max. I want it to last as long as possible so that is why I went to plus. I hope I didn't make a mistake because I DO have smaller hands.,2024-01-26T21:41:58Z,2024-01-26
ITsMdoaoDPk,I have the s24 regular and I love it. I have small hands and it's even a tiny bit big for me. I came from the iPhone 13 mini and so it's a step up as far as size. The features and cameras are exactly what I needed!,2024-07-21T14:44:50Z,2024-07-21
ITsMdoaoDPk,i really wish that the S24 ultra is smaller in size but keeping same specs,2024-03-03T04:00:42Z,2024-03-03
ITsMdoaoDPk,"Definitely a good comparision. For the battery test, you should note that both Ultra and Plus can be extended if you use FHD res. To make it more comparable use same resolution next. Your comparing the phones itself, so it should be ""comparable"". It might be possible that with the same resolution the Ultra and Plus still doesn't perform well enough. Just make sure to eliminate other variables. For the next video, I think the S23 Ultra vs S24 Ultra would really be a good one. This is in the perspective of buying from a previous generation of phones of course. S24 Ultra seem less compelling, because of it's just generally 23 with AI. With the lower price of the 23 Ultra and mostly the same specs, it is still good for people upgrading from previous generations.",2024-01-27T05:24:33Z,2024-01-27
ITsMdoaoDPk,regular S24 is perfect if it had 512gb storage but because only S24 plus and S24 Ultra only have that option I'm leaning towards the S24 Plus.,2024-01-27T00:41:12Z,2024-01-27

4. When i want to take full control of screenshot and screenshot editing with precise screen writing.

3. Easier for editing check stubs/ documents to meet or help friends meet the qualification of something

2. Signing (or editing) PDFs and sending them back in record timing

1. Editing watermarks out of my kids school pictures

I dont use it all the time but i absolutely dont want to be without it. Sort of like my jumper cables. I cant remember the last time my car died. But I've jumped peoples car like twice this year.

Then all a sudden the S24 was on sale down from $1200aud to $877 which is literally half the price of the plus. So I got it. Love it just a little small after years of my old S10 plus.

RcFKsAUzcXM,"the reason i bought note 9 second hand some times ago is because its the most affordable stylus phone that i could buy at the time that still works ok. truly an on site work phone. take photos, draw arrows, circles, jot notes directly, and sent it to other division in real time, its precise so you can write smaller and longer sentences without zooming and its readable. very nice. should be on cheaper mid range phone with big battery rather than as a complementary stuff on the top of your product line. way better than carrying rugged big tablet with poor battery stylus for on site job. you tend to baby those expensive phone so it lasts long but it defeats the puropse of having stylus on a phone in the first place. its for work.",2025-04-16T15:05:37Z,2025-04-16

Stuck wjth a phone i didnt want for 2 years because sometimes life sucks. I unfortunately was forced into the situation. My Note 20 5G Ultra had antenna issues, a cracked screen (first time ever) and thereforee holds no data connection. Went to a repair shop and $300 for antenna, screen replacements. Now my battery is swelling. 
I have a personal situation with one of my children that requires a need for constant ability to reach me. Needed to borrow $650, which i could have paid back, but no one would help me. Not even my daughter's father who lives with his parents and pays for nothing. 
Not looking for hand outs, nothing like that. 
Im juat very different. Any time i was financially able, i helped all i could. Tables have turned and i have no one willing to help me.

I‚Äôm really sad that the S25 Ultra now also has rounded edges like every other smartphone in the world. It‚Äôs such a shame. I find it‚Äôs a good design and something different compared to others. It looks great, you get a bit more display, and videos fit the screen better than on rounded smartphones.

What I also don‚Äôt understand is why you think it‚Äôs a problem. I use mine without a screen protector or case, and I can hold it just like in the video without any issues or discomfort.",2025-01-05T02:11:10Z,2025-01-05

cEj1gHCoidQ,"For me the S24 Ultra does the job, and actually that S pen downgrade is way worse than someone might think, because it's very useful in day to day usage. And don't forget that all these software upgrades will be soon available on the S24 Ultra too",2025-02-14T21:36:40Z,2025-02-14
cEj1gHCoidQ,"Sorry, but the S25 Ultra is clearly WORSE in the camera category. Moreover, screen-wise, as tested by JerryRigEverything, the coating and protection of the S25 Ultra is WORSE than the S24 Ultra. Gaming-wise, the S25 Ultra is better in native games, but the S24 Ultra is miles ahead in emulated games. S Pen changes are personal, if you use it, there is NO way to believe the S25 Ultra is even a comparison. Overall, I'd recommend the S24 Ultra until the S26 Ultra comes around.",2025-05-01T11:01:26Z,2025-05-01

cEj1gHCoidQ,"S25U lost its distinct character of being an Ultra with the rounded edge, Now looking more like an A series phone.
Same was the story with S21, which ditched the QHD for standard model.

Unboxing experience for the flagship model also drastically down from S21.
Gone are the days when AKG Earphone & Charger were neatly included in the box. Yet we are still paying a premium.",2025-02-15T06:26:41Z,2025-02-15

cEj1gHCoidQ,"If you have good trade-in deals, S25 Ultra. 
If not, you can get the S24 Ultra usually for 40% off, even unsealed. Its how i got my S23 Ultra for 40% off exactly a year ago.
Id still recommend the S24 line even if youre upgrading from a very old device as youre still getting 90-95% of the phone anyway.",2025-02-14T20:39:22Z,2025-02-14

cEj1gHCoidQ,This guy has been quite fair in his videos since the S25 Ultra came out. The S24 series cameras are better in clarity and details than the S25 series. The same thing between my S24 and the S25 I'm trying out,2025-02-14T21:11:33Z,2025-02-14

cEj1gHCoidQ,"(S24 Ultra VS S25 Ultra)

S24 Ultra
- Box Style shape (Just like the original note series)
- S24 Ultra first flat screen with eligant curved frame gives premium style (Flat screen protector frienldy)
- Brightness was tested as ive seen and notice is brighter. (Coating or what not probably causing this but the anti reflection is nearly identical)
- S-Pen bluetooth (Gimick or useful but still very nice knowing you have some inspector gadget type tech in your pocket if needed)
- One UI 7 Update for the S24U has some new video exporting blowing away the non optimized version of the S25 U as seen and tested.
- Camera rings are solid and premium (Flush no potential removal)
- 7 years of update (S24U) and was originally advertised as the AI phone already (I use all the AI features Minus the Now brief on the S25 Ultra i had it turned off)
- S-pen location on the S24 Ultra is in a perfect spot for cases (S25 Ultra seems to have it in a odd location where its curved so all the cases have a nasty open cutout in the corner)

S25 Ultra
- Feels like an Iphone which i always envyed iphone users having a flat square display but the samsung design lost its touch reminds me of the redmagic phone (not Note shape)
- Faster CPU but samsung is behind updating a more optimized version for the S25 Ultra
- Nearly only one year extra of uptades vs the S24 U 
- Extra pixels in one camera (I dont see the difference)
- Blue tooth 5.4 vs 5.3 (Dont notice much maybe the 6.0 will be a bigger upgrade.


Conclusion:
Sending my S25 Ultra back and will continue to use the S24 Ultra (I will snag a new one when they come back to the Note roots i have  under 7 years not in a hurry but ill cross my fingers on this one)",2025-06-07T02:58:10Z,2025-06-07

cEj1gHCoidQ,"I just purchased a Sam Sung Galaxy Ultra S-25 phone. It is loaded with many features.
I wanted the 1 TB model but T-Mobile only offered the 512 gig version. If you want
the 1 TB you have to order it from Sam Sung.

My old phone, the LG Q70 could accept a 2 TB SD card. I opted to get a 1 TB 
micro SD card which offered me lots of storage for large drone files.

I found out this S-25 has the capability of accepting external memory in the form
of thumb drives that have a USB-C connector. When recording video you can
go in the phone video mode and select external memory.

Plugging in a USB-C thumb drive looks cumbersome. I would like someone to come
out with an adapter that would fit the underside of the phone that has a USB-C connector
along with either 512 gig or 1 TB of storage.
This external add-on module wouldn‚Äôt have to be any larger than maybe 1‚Äù and the width of
the phone while still letting the user access the stylus.",2025-03-20T22:43:30Z,2025-03-20

cEj1gHCoidQ,"Great review! ‚ù§
I would go with the S24U. It looks more premium and I like the colour range better. I'm not so much into the rounded edges, although I am sure it is more comfortable to use the S25U. I think that these companies are making us pay way too much and they don't even throw a charging block, no longer have expandable storage, no headphone jack, the battery hasn't changed in years and the wireless charging speed is pathetic. Also, even if they claim less than 1% of people used the bluetooth S pen feature, why downgrade on the S25U? Seriously, they're laughing to the bank with their shareholders because they're ripping us off big time. Less for more money, when we got more for less before. Oh, and the presentation of the phones after blowing ridiculous money on them is sad. The lack of a nice presentation after dropping that amount of coin is disgusting. 

In the end since I need a phone. I'll see if I can get an S24U for a little less money.

I would never trade-in my S23 ultra for this. Downgraded spen, Downgraded camera rings, and Downgraded width.

I love the rounded corners, but the sharp edges - not so much. Other than that and the new UW camera, there are no real HW upgrades. I don't count the new SoC as an upgrade because with every new generation, it is expected. I think this is the last generation where Samsung could afford to get away with so little improvement.
