The a15 does everything that the Google pixel 8 does, at least according to my needs (the camera on the Pixel 8 is better, however). I actually like the larger size of the a15, and for those who worry about the sturdiness of the case in the screen, you can get a rubberized case and screen covers for $10 or $15 total, making it hard to break.

We're outside the 2 week return period, so now we need to try and bring it in the next time the issue shows up as they won't do anything unless they see the issue, but it happens sporadically and makes even restarting the phone difficult when it happens. A replacement might have the same issue so we were hoping to return the phone and go for a different model, but they said we have to go through warranty first.

Even the technician gave us a look the second he saw we had a A15 because he knew it was trouble.

Would not recommend this phone unless you don't mind your phone becoming unusable every once in a while.",7,2024-10-26T21:54:33Z

Needless to say, I needed to shop for a new phone but was determined to get an OLED screen. I got the A15 LTE for $199 in Canada. What an incredible phone and value. The S24 Ultra is 2 grand in Canada and this phone keeps up nicely and had Android 14 installed. 
Im grateful that Samsung has a cheaper line of phones but also that they are making them so well. 
Everything about this phone is incredible for 2 hundred bucks.
Spring for the 5G model though. I should have thrown in the extra 25. My LTE is a little slow at times.",41,2024-09-15T01:42:54Z

Let me say that this phone is a real disappointment. Its extremely slow. Some web pages or apps would not load completely. Its laggy. The processor is slow and only has 4GB of ram which isn't enough especially for a modern phone. Got luck trying to upgrade this phone in the future. I only had it for 4 days before I realised this phone would not be frustrating to say the least. The only positive of this phone was the real vibrant and bright AMOLED screen. I went back to my poco X3 pro and it now feels better and slicker than what it felt before I used the A15. Shame this phone will not work as it a beast of a budget phone.,0,2024-08-19T13:47:41Z

MP-aGSJJsvk,@deepfriedsponge898,"As an owner of both the A13 and A14, I do not recommend buying the phones unless you have good knowledge on how phones works or you're willing to pay for the 5G version which for some reason doesn't seem to have many issues. 
Why do I say this?
1. The amount of lag is incredible, and many times I'll scroll on instagram unable to watch the reels bc of how laggy they are
2. It happened various times that the phone was about to explode after doing the smallest thing ever. Literally yesterday as wrting this my phone decided to black screen for 3 HOURS just because I closed an app too fast
3. It has problems with Literally anything. Either they lag when turning on the wifi, connecting a bluetooth device, or while installing something 
There's much more that probably comes to mind (like that once half of my gallery disappeared) but you get my point. The worst part is that the A14 is for some reason triple the size of the A13 (except for the screen size) yet the performance is the same. 
My conclusion then, is that don't buy this A1 or the A0 since they're a waste of money. I've had so much frustration over theses two phones that unless you have the money to buy the 5g versions, don't buy them. Either you buy an A2 or later lineup or you don't buy a Samsung at all. It's so sad how they slowly became the same thing as Apple... maybe I'm exaggerating maybe not either way I absolutely do not recommend the A15 even tho I've never used it",0,2024-08-08T00:04:41Z

MP-aGSJJsvk,@gh0stcat387,I got this phone free when changing service and went from an A53 5G to this. I know the A53 has better specs but with day to day use they seem about the same. I'll probably go back to my A53 just because the camera is better but other than that it would be hard to tell them apart. I think the fingerprint reader is better on the A15 and it has an actual headphone jack so those even things out a little.,37,2024-02-26T09:36:32Z

MP-aGSJJsvk,@zahimbaqaye3180,"Brought 4G of  this phone two weeks ago 160$ 6GB RAM and 128GB of ROM

PROS ARE
1 Amoled display but compared to other phones like even galaxy s8 it looks little cheap idk why. 
2 Battery is perfect it consume 10% every hour of screen time
3 One UI 6 is pretty good with no lag.
4 fingerprint scanner is very responsive and very fast i love it.

Cons 
1 No HDR support for display.

2 bulky design and applying case and screen protector make it very heavy.

3 No OIS or EIS for camera. And 50mp photos looks washed out front camera is taking good photos but looks unnatural.

4 phone back is plastic and fingerprint marks are very visible. After wiping it several times tiny scratches was visible which is not good. I applied plastic protection in the back to solve further scratches.

5 Front screen have no protection its normal glass I was very sad that it didn't have any type of glass  protection. So I applied screen protector to keep it safe.",4,2024-02-22T17:33:18Z
