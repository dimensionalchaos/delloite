MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought this phone and it's crazy to me that this was a budget phone. I literally ordered it online, added a nice case and had it delivered in about 40 minutes... all for under $200 total. The amount of bang for your buck is pretty crazy and although I'm used to my iPad finger sensor location, I am really liking the feature built into the power button. Also, battery life matters to me and this is an upgrade over my last phone."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Let’s be honest, for most people this phone checks all the boxes."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just got this phone. It's a very fast equipped phone when your on the go and in a fast pace environment. Like the fingerprint unlock feature is on point. The swiping on point too
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got mine for $128 out the door from T-Mobile today. I have an iPhone 11 and the A15 5G is definitely an upgrade.
MP-aGSJJsvk,The phone to get for people who want the features that matter the most to most smartphone users without wanting to pay up to $1000 more for any of the S24 models. I'd buy it.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"GSMARENA was my go to before the YouTube review era!!
Good to see you guys!!
Subbed!!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review! I have upgraded my Samsung A12 on this because it has 5G. Man, Samsung is very durable. My A12 is still good after 3 years of use. You can never go wrong with Samsung!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I switched from S21 to this phone because of the longer battery, but it ticks all of the boxes I need for a phone. No need spending much and this phone doesnt need a cover"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got this phone free when changing service and went from an A53 5G to this. I know the A53 has better specs but with day to day use they seem about the same. I'll probably go back to my A53 just because the camera is better but other than that it would be hard to tell them apart. I think the fingerprint reader is better on the A15 and it has an actual headphone jack so those even things out a little.
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15... Got her today... On my hand the most beautiful creature made by Samsung. Love it. 😊😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review. This A15 5G looks identical to my A25, but I am glad I bought the latter, the extra 50 bucks price difference seems to be worth it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got one a month ago and it is the best bang for your buck. The display is 🔥
MP-aGSJJsvk,In video speaker test like the old days! Classic 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,I bought this phone just for my curiosity and it's pretty good aside from the meh camera quality. I own a Pixel 8 Pro and honestly this phone is pretty good for those on a very strict budget.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was attacked and robbed recently of my S24 Ultra and Switch OLED and 1800 in cash. Needless to say, I needed to shop for a new phone but was determined to get an OLED screen. I got the A15 LTE for $199 in Canada. What an incredible phone and value. The S24 Ultra is 2 grand in Canada and this phone keeps up nicely and had Android 14 installed. 
Im grateful that Samsung has a cheaper line of phones but also that they are making them so well. 
Everything about this phone is incredible for 2 hundred bucks.
Spring for the 5G model though. I should have thrown in the extra 25. My LTE is a little slow at times."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"It’s good to see Amoled screen on Samsung’s budget phones. However, I think I’m gonna wait for A55 if it has some interesting upgrade too."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Most people using phones at this price range won't be needing the 5G speed, I appreciate the option thou, but getting the cheaper 4G model is probably the wiser choice."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought the Galaxy A15 a few days ago and so far I like it. It's probably too early to say for sure but so far it's a pretty good phone. I bought the Samsung galaxy A20 around 3 years ago and I loved it! Until the screen pixels crapped out on me after 2 or 3 months. I paid $80 to repair the screen and the new screen crappmonths. after 6 months. I was soon mad!!! 😂😭😠 So,  I'll wait past 6 months to see how this version really works for me. 😅😊"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for this review. I had to buy one 4 days ago, when the screen of my device which i had for almost 4 years gave out. I actually really like it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why is the Samsung A15 4G faster than the A15 5G when I always hear that 5G connectivity phones are faster ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got it. Replacement for my overheated s21, its really good for a budget phone"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Dear Samsung please get rid of this dam notch.Bring the punch hole in all of your devices.It is a humble request
MP-aGSJJsvk,Bought it yesterday and I'm in love with it perfect phone❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 5G was released march 2023 herr in Phil. I bought mine march31 2023. .and I am very satisfied for the quality. My friends went crazy when I use this under the rain 🤣🤣🤣 until now nothing change, it seems like brand new when it comes to phone overl all performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Galaxy A15 my dream phone 😍 cant wait to save money and buy this to play my favourite games, Pree Payyee and Pabjee Mobeel at 8k max settings 500fps wow"
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15 is basically A24 in disguise
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Updated comment: Guess the issue at 3:22 verifies Notebookcheck's test of the A15 LTE having better UFS controllers than the 5G version.

Original comment: Any other complaints that aren't based on skill issues?😂
Some website said the 4G version has faster storage speed despite both models being UFS 2.2."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Some corrections:
The A15 5G uses a different processer than the A15 4G. Both phones have OIS, not EIS, both phones get supported for 4 years OS updates, 5 years for security, and you can change the display colours on both devices,and both phones can take 50 mp photos for more detail which they didnt do in the camera test for some reason."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 User here. I'm super happy with it's recent updates, improving performance and so on."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The one thing that I like about this phone and Samsung phones in general is the sound quality in videos, they sound pretty nice, my S20 FE captures sounds with great quality and I couldn't be more happier. This A15 has great quality sound in video as well."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I love Samsung Galaxy A15 5G, I did some tests on it, didn't even break, I even poured water on it, didn't do ANY damage!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got my Galaxy phone....loving it so far...
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This may be wrong of me to ask here but what about Angie? Like personally, are you guys still keep in touch with her? I know she moved on to start her own channel but she hasn't posted anything in a while. Both here and on her Instagram. I'm just worried about her. So please if you guys have any news, please share. Thank you."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I will buy this phone end of may, from A03 to A15.
The best budget phone between A05s & A25"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Yay ive been waiting for this video
MP-aGSJJsvk,Watching this on my Samsung A34. I love Samsung
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got mine yesterday and I really enjoy it. It's much faster than the a20 i had.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Hey I have this phone just 2 days ago!
It was a really good phone and I am gonna use this phone for my school thats gonna start in 4 more days
Really shines and does more!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Nice review, many thanks. Apologies for my ignorance, but why would one need or prefer 4g vs 5g or vice versa? Thanks."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you so much Gsmarena
MP-aGSJJsvk,"My wife got this phone. A couple weeks in it started to get random issues locking up due to ghost touch, making the phone unusable until she restarts it. Seems to be a common issue online.

We're outside the 2 week return period, so now we need to try and bring it in the next time the issue shows up as they won't do anything unless they see the issue, but it happens sporadically and makes even restarting the phone difficult when it happens. A replacement might have the same issue so we were hoping to return the phone and go for a different model, but they said we have to go through warranty first.

Even the technician gave us a look the second he saw we had a A15 because he knew it was trouble.

Would not recommend this phone unless you don't mind your phone becoming unusable every once in a while."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got two for switching from Metro to T-mobile for free. They should be here Wed. Can't wait. My a12 is old and acting up and my daughter's A07 is definitely giving up the ghost; so prayerfully made the right choice.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Samsung did a good job for thier budget phones.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently just got the A15 4G
And I love it
I have no complains
It's fast and reliable.
I also play call of duty mobile with great frame rate and almost no lags
Tho lags are every endurable
It's the best budget phone I've ever used"
MP-aGSJJsvk,1:50 i dont understand some phone companies the flagships won't have headphone Jacks but their mid-range will just keep the headphone jack all together
MP-aGSJJsvk,THANK YOU SO MUCH 4 THE TOUR 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,Saw her for one second and have never been happier to get her back with me
MP-aGSJJsvk,But how does it work as a telephone?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got two of these phones for free with T-Mobile as a family plan and everyone satisfied I really like it
MP-aGSJJsvk,Big fan of this video visual direction 🙏
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This phone impressed me! For an entry level, you can't go wrong with this!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why are they still releasing a separate 5g and 4g version? 5g stopped being a premium (or even midrange) feature years ago.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"im buying this phone soon, my dad has a phone like that and it is very great. I suggest ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can you watch youtube videos while browsing or using other apps?
MP-aGSJJsvk,For what ive read its 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security patches.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently bought a Google Pixel 8 and bought an a15 for an emergency spare. The a15 does everything that the Google pixel 8 does, at least according to my needs (the camera on the Pixel 8 is better, however). I actually like the larger size of the a15, and for those who worry about the sturdiness of the case in the screen, you can get a rubberized case and screen covers for $10 or $15 total, making it hard to break. If I had to do it all over again, I would buy an a15 or an a25, and skip the pixel 8."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have a midrange a73 5g since 2022. I must say its still good and i heavily use my phone on a daily basis
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got the A15 a few weeks ago and it runs so well.  A big upgrade from my Moto G Pure.  I got tired of Moto.
MP-aGSJJsvk,The best phone ever I switched from iphone and it's hands down the best phone I ever used people paying all this money for iphones and flagship phones doesn't make sense
MP-aGSJJsvk,I gave my daughter this phone hope she likes it❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you much for the info.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"To be honest I have it and I'm not really happy with it. It's extremly chunky and power button is horrible to use. I can never use it without looking, you can barelly feel it. I would not recommend it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Good review. Happy with my A15. Battery life is awesome.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The A15 5G is not slower because it's a 5G model, it's because there was a firmware and software issue. This has now been fixed by Samsung."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Even my 3yr old Redmi note 9pro max doesn't lag
MP-aGSJJsvk,Your nerdy ness helped me
MP-aGSJJsvk,What a beauty 😍 i got mine last week 8gb 256gb rom 🎉
MP-aGSJJsvk,0:45 I’m here to watch the great review on this phone I just found at $100 dollars and with all due respect I started to watch this video and I was thinking about the “uncle Roger”guy lol😜I hope you don’t get offended by my dumb comment 😮
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just want to use the phone for doing deliveries like doordash and Uber eats. Don't care about the photos.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just shattered my 21ultra so i think im gumna pull the trigger on this budget phone for a while
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Bro samsung A34 or moto edge 40 neo ?
Which is best?"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I bought this phone as i lost my  A12 which had a great camera.and the wide angle shots were good. Hoping for a better camera , the A15's is very disappointing, and the ultra wide mode produces appalling blurry shots even in good light and with really poor results. Not what i was expecting from Samsung when my A12 camera was better by miles. Very disappointed."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Which games are u playing on Samsung a15 in this video?
MP-aGSJJsvk,My elder brother bought this for me 😊❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Getting mine on Friday ❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have recently bought the Samsung AO5s and Samsung A15 4G.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you for this review. I found it most helpful. Gale
MP-aGSJJsvk,"How many years updates? And IP rating?
I'm sticking with Sony 10vi. Gives me 3.5mm headphone socket, sd card slot and way better wireless audio than any other android phone at the price. Oh and insane battery life, twice that of the pixel 8a."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I got this phone i like it was tottalu worth ot with my laptop and it can gp up to 2k ""1440p"" Resluton. Its totally worth it especially While play games or also video edit 2k at 60  and its Smooth and its cool. :)"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have the ZFlip (2020) and I’m using it as a work phone. Should i upgrade to this one?
MP-aGSJJsvk,I've had a Galaxy A51 for a few years and I recently bought a A15 5g.I like it but my heart will always be with my A51 lol
MP-aGSJJsvk,"i got this to replace my redmi 8 pro as the battery was dying. great phone, feels solid, camera is not as good as only 30fps but that doesnt bother me. has all the bells and whisltles like NFC. cant fault it for a £100 phone ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Great Phone i recently buy this and very smooth runing
MP-aGSJJsvk,Can they use the same phone cases?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"it is very decent, perfect for daily light/moderate use. I love the battery performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you gsm
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I want to know, please do this A15 phone has 3G, 4G, and 5G?"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have A15 i switched upgraded to Samsung galaxy S25
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This is getting 4 year OS + 5 years security, not 3 years OS!
It's right in their product page!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,This is a very nice phone for the money. I like the knock on and off feature as well.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Which is better to buy A15 4g or A15 5g
MP-aGSJJsvk,Nice. I you bought this phone as a back up for $40 bucks✊🏼
MP-aGSJJsvk,Would you rather have this or iPhone 13 /13 mini?
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got one today, not upgraded since the A32 5g 3 years ago"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Watching This on GALAXY A15😎😎
MP-aGSJJsvk,"You bear a striking resemblance to Jim Jones. 
Anyway great video. Wish these historical people would have survived to see this technology."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for the review: comprehensive, succinct, and interesting."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Got an A15 4G as an ondependent MP3 and Spotify Player as my Note 20 didn't have an headphone jack. Up until now its the perfect running mate for all the stuff i don't want the expensive phone onvolved (i.e. in the workshop, shoveling snow or when exercising) the other phones job includes taking pictures (whitch the a15 is not that good at, to put it mildly)"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"bit confused as to the tone in this review compared to the 4G version, is the camera not the same? I watched it a few days ago (since thats the model I'm getting) and I remember him talking much more negatively about the camera"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have this phone for 1 Mos now and I love it
