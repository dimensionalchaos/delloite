fFCGtAmse5c,"Thank you for this!  I'm 77rrs old and I really needed the help.  My 'digital Grans and great grans don't come up to the country often, I would be lost if I hadn't found your channel.  You earned my 'subscribe!'    I dropped my A12 and it didn't survive  but this phone is all this old man needs. 🤠"
fFCGtAmse5c,I upgraded to this phone from my Samsung A11❤  It's so good alongside with my Tab A9 Plus!
fFCGtAmse5c,The color reminds me of the Samsung Note 10+ Aura Glow. It's beautiful. The bottom speaker cutout also matches the new S24 series. Anyway great video!
fFCGtAmse5c,That fact that you can get a phone this good for that price is absolutely insane.
fFCGtAmse5c,I will be upgrading to this phone from my tracfone journey LG. Great review.
fFCGtAmse5c,That color is beautiful it's like the prism white from the s10 series.
fFCGtAmse5c,"A bit late, but i guess I'll say my opinion. 

The A15 5g is most likely going to be one of Samsung's best selling smartphones, especially after all the upgrades. 

The biggest upgrade with the A15 is the display, no doubt. AMOLED is such a improvement, not just for gamers, but for everyday users alike due to much better color saturation and deeper blacks. The 90Hz also helps. 

Performance wise, the 128GB base storage option is very nice, the chipset ain't going to impress everyone, but its good enough for simple gaming and everyday browsing. 

Design wise, its nice and cool for most people. 

The only thing that turns people away from it is speakers and video, the speaker isn't great, dual speakers is great for music and the fact its capped on 30 fps 1080p video is upsetting. I mean i don't hate the fact that its resolution is 1080p, its just if your going to cap it on FHD, At least give a 60 fps option. 

For the price, its a very good value phone, and will still hold up in the future (Especially compared to the A05)"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Another great vid Wade!

This is such an awesome value... Samsung really killed it this year on the A15.  They did really well in choosing the right trade-offs for most people, while still keeping it at this very affordable price point."
fFCGtAmse5c,Apple should learn a thing or two from a under $200 phone about how to provide higher refresh rate display in their Non-pro line-up 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,It's a good affordable phone for the average person. I think spending lots of money on a phone is dumb.
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm tempted to buy this as a backup.
fFCGtAmse5c,"I was going to buy a much more expensive phone but I’m quite happy with this! I’m not gaming, or even phoning much. And I’m usually at home so I can use my home internet with the apps.❤🇨🇦"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Working wireless, the budget phones were always the most exciting. Seeing people who cannot afford much get better features each year was nice to see. Especially when Samsung went from the A12 to A13. Phone went from awful to useable. A14 got better and hit 1080p, but now with more ram if you get those models these phones should hopefully be able to just work now."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Bought this and loving it.

Only thing is I'm not able to have my YouTube notifications pop up on my notifications bar. I've checked all my settings and notifications are allowed .... so"
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm watching on a a15 😂😂😂
fFCGtAmse5c,This is my phone now and im so inlove with it. ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,Best review so far well explained without pressure ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,History will be made when Samsung finally decides to put punch hole display 😂
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm getting it on April 10th only 1 months so excited
fFCGtAmse5c,watching this in my samsung a15 !!
fFCGtAmse5c,"This is unrelated but this is what I think a killer S24 FE would be: Even Bezels they don’t have to be that thin kinda like s21 fe side bezels, Snapdragon gen 2, 5000mah, fix that silver ring around the front camera and make it look like the other flagships, also the cameras can be slightly improved but they already are pretty decent. Although I don’t think Samsung would ever do something this ambitious. Overall great video on the A15 5g!"
fFCGtAmse5c,The samsung galaxy a15 5g awesome phone the color is similar to the samsung galaxy s10 plus prism white and the samsung galaxy note 10 and 10+ and not bad at all
fFCGtAmse5c,This phone paired with the LG Gram Style 16 laptop is just perfect
fFCGtAmse5c,This is by far the best easily! And the colour i got mine is the same light blue it's got the ethereal touch
fFCGtAmse5c,"Not talking about this phone but still budget Samsung related, I actually have a Galaxy Tab A7 Lite lying around which I got during my early uni years and just days before it received the One UI 6.0 update as well. Mind you it was released back in June 2021 and it still gets OS updates (which I thought One UI Core 5.0 was going to its last update before Samsung forgets about this tablet.) It's a fairly slow device, but with its price it is such a wonderful media consumption device. With 3rd party equalizers the built in speakers are actually nice. When I bought it  I really didnt expect it to be supported for such a long time."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Man, you're right on time with this one! I'm currently sitting behind my computer deciding on Samsung Galaxy A15 5G vs Motorola Moto G Play (2024) vs OnePlus Nord N30 5G. Which one would you recommend? I need something cheap and basic, mainly for calls and looking up stuff online occasionally."
fFCGtAmse5c,6:24 How are you supposed to listen to calls without a speaker near selfie camera?
fFCGtAmse5c,It would be nice if you could do a software comparison to more expensive samsung phones. Interested to see what they've omitted.
fFCGtAmse5c,I just ordered one of these the other day switchinf from my 6 year old Motorola that started having issues a couple months ago. I'm so frustrated with! Thank you for this video.
fFCGtAmse5c,"I go one android than an iPhone then android then iPhone.

These android phones are getting better and better for a low price.

Moto G73 ATM. I'm happy"
fFCGtAmse5c,"My personal phone is a samsung S24 , iv had it a while and was ready to upgrade when my work gave me a new A15, i think its a great lil phone, im actually considering getting A15 as my personal fone lol"
fFCGtAmse5c,Play tech daily my name each. Me purchased the A15-5G. From Metro by T-Mobile. Tanks dis video iss very very helpful. I love ya Content plz keep pit up.
fFCGtAmse5c,A 15 5 is a masterpiece from samsung ❤❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just got mine yesterday, and so far I love the panel, 5g and 50mp camera. I'm more than willing to deal with the single speaker and poor video quality"
fFCGtAmse5c,I love the fact that you are always so honest when reviewing phones.
fFCGtAmse5c,❤ Love it. Huge improvements in memory capacity & screen over A14.
fFCGtAmse5c,"I have one. It's my first ever Samsung. It's okay. It lags but it's good for 270 CAD. The camera is descent. Annyoing things: common lag, huge bezels, U shaped notch, etc. I am switching to a Galaxy A55 soon. Overall okay. Not a very fluid phone, but the rest is okay."
fFCGtAmse5c,Ironically I just got the Samsung galaxy a14 5g. And I love it. 😂😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
fFCGtAmse5c,I have a a51 and I think I might get this new a15 just because of the price the new a 55 5G in Canada 🇨🇦 now is like 600 dollars its getting up there so I think I'll go with the a15 great video and thank you
fFCGtAmse5c,I absolutely love my Samsung A15 4G 128GB . I am going to purchase the Samsung A15 5G 256GB version and the Samsung A25 5G 256GB version.
fFCGtAmse5c,"This is (compared to A14) big upgrade to A10 series. I wanted to buy A14 5G but no ultra-wide camera, slow as f charging and goofy bezels was big no. Now this is all fixed with A15 5G :D"
fFCGtAmse5c,YES i waited so much for u to do this video W VIDEO MAN
fFCGtAmse5c,Oof nice phone. i’m going to get one on 2024 christmas man 🎄
fFCGtAmse5c,I want to upgrade from samsung a 12 should i choose this or anathor company phone someone please reply ????
fFCGtAmse5c,Finally a praise worthy review 🎉🎉
fFCGtAmse5c,"Seems like a nice change from my A10E, that clearly needs an upgrade watching the screen go bezerk."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Those waching on 2025
⬇️"
fFCGtAmse5c,If you only used your phone to watch YouTube and check emails would you buy the A15 or the A05s? Im being forced to uprage from my nokia G20 due to 3g no longer being supported.
fFCGtAmse5c,I see that international version of Samsung A25 is sold cheaper and just 50 more than A15. Despite that Exynos has bad rep it is still faster than Dimensity 6100+.
fFCGtAmse5c,In my region I have the 4g variant. Whats your opinion about that?
fFCGtAmse5c,Why my samsung a15 lte doesn't have  a video stabilization like yours? Where I can find? Is there any set about it?
fFCGtAmse5c,Just got my own today
fFCGtAmse5c,Super Super Sir👌👌👍👍👏👏👏👏👏
fFCGtAmse5c,I BOUGHT IT THREE YEARS AGO AND IT IS VERY GOOD 👍
fFCGtAmse5c,One speaker two speakers it doesn’t matter because anyone who listens to music through the speakers on their phone should have their ears cut off
fFCGtAmse5c,"i hope for their future a16, they do the punch hole in the side like what they did to a11"
fFCGtAmse5c,"I have a A15 (mine’s the A154G with the Helio G99 though). 

The new A16 5G isn’t out in the U.S. yet though it is in the UK, India, Australia, Asia,etc-has 6 years software updates promise and the successor to the A15 5G."
fFCGtAmse5c,"Waiting for a A25 review
Idk when, But im gonna wait."
fFCGtAmse5c,I ordered mine free through my carrier. As long as I had service and a certain plan. Was looking into a new budget friendly phone.
fFCGtAmse5c,I'm always on the go is this phone good to watch movies? Does it have Dolby Atmos? How is the screen resolution  and does it take good pictures and videos??
fFCGtAmse5c,I have a older A51 do you think this would be a good enough phone for me to buy or should I spend alot more money and buy a new A55 because they are very pricey in Canada 🇨🇦
fFCGtAmse5c,oled always right😮
fFCGtAmse5c,I don’t understand how the a11 and a12 had hole punch selfie camera and had thinner bezels.
fFCGtAmse5c,I had came from the a21 to the a15 and I love the a15
fFCGtAmse5c,"Is a Samsung Galaxy A24 4G still a better buy than this ??? 
Btw..my Samsung A71 speaker sounds the same as this new A15 …😂."
fFCGtAmse5c,Thanks. I only came here for the apps pre installed ❤
fFCGtAmse5c,I wish they bring back A11 front camera design for their upcoming entry level phone
fFCGtAmse5c,Im getting this soon
fFCGtAmse5c,I love your videos today I'm gonna get two one for my wife and one for her daughter❤❤❤❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,"got mine on amazn  comming wed. ,,, exited"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Cracked my A13 screen. So im buying this one, hopefully i will be impressed"
fFCGtAmse5c,Great amazing ❤❤
fFCGtAmse5c,Why didn't it come with screen recording
fFCGtAmse5c,"I want to buy this phone for my mom, she doesn't want a flagship phone, just a phone that will replace her old clunky galaxy A20. 😅"
fFCGtAmse5c,"I was going to upgrade to this. I have an A13, but most people have told me it is a minor upgrade. Not really major"
fFCGtAmse5c,"Me with my Galaxy S24 Ultra: 😂😂😂😂

Joke aside, for someone, who just needs a simple phone or doesn't have much money this is a great joice but for me, who needs fast and big phones with a very good camera the A15 isn't it, because i had A series Phones before but they always get slow and laggy after 2 Months and the cameras, durability, cheap plastics and Performance aren't the best. Because i do almost everything on my phone, watching videos, making videos mostly in 4K, playing games, writing documents, multitasking and much more"
fFCGtAmse5c,"A25 is leagues better. It really is the best option this year so far. Please, if you're going to buy a budget samsung phone, please save your money up for atleast an A25 5G. If your looking for hardware which is near flagship material but with a headphone jack, I'd say the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 pro is a much better and cheaper option."
fFCGtAmse5c,Is this phone for recording videos?
fFCGtAmse5c,Bro battery died 5hrs charge 😢 5:05
fFCGtAmse5c,there is a secondary speaker you couldn't do phone calls without it. But its not configured as stereo speakers.
fFCGtAmse5c,The first thing is 6.5 or even less is the best size for any cell phone
fFCGtAmse5c,"I just bought 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my wife at walmart for 139.99 each!!!"
fFCGtAmse5c,"My uncle purchased the Indian retail unit of this in the blue black colour and I gave him a heads up on the technology side of a smartphone. He upgraded from a Nokia 6.2 so he definitely lost on the build quality, but he gained on a lot more aspects. I use an A34 5G [i wanted an A33 5g originally but got the middle variant of the same once i noted the improvements]."
fFCGtAmse5c,I’m watching this while having a Gabb phone 4 pro 😭😂
fFCGtAmse5c,I actually got this and my friends thought it is an samsung s24
fFCGtAmse5c,"Could you do a video on how to ONLY use memory card NOT have photos go into my phone, PLEASE! 😊"
fFCGtAmse5c,"When turn on the phone, why only showed samsung galaxy?? Why not samsung galaxy A15 5G?? 😮😮"
fFCGtAmse5c,I was offer a brand new ( unused) pixel 7 for the same Price as the A15 5g so what would be the best phone?? I have a lot of movie and tv series on the playstore lots of audiobook from audible and Watching youtube video
fFCGtAmse5c,I have to phone for around 2 weeks. It work great for me because I am a truck driver so really all I do is watch YouTube and talk on the phone. The only issue I have had is some water splashed on it and the top camera(ultra wide) has some moisture in it. That makes the ultra wide pictures a little fuzzy. It also struggles with depth because of that. It's a great phone just don't get it wet at all!!!😂😂😂😂
fFCGtAmse5c,"Somehow this phone's display is better than the one on my a54. My a54 has terrible viewing angles, tilting the screen ever so slightly gives the screen a green cast, and whites look weird, kind of greenish, if you squint, it's because there are tiny green and purple pixels scattered on the display. None of that was present in the a15's display, whites look actually white and more comforting to the eye, viewing angles are not as bad, i didn't see the weird scattered green and purple pixels, and yeah in general the difference was night-and-day"
fFCGtAmse5c,"NIce, im planning to buy the 6GB RAM + 128GB storage (Samsung galaxy A15 5G Double slim) version :)"
fFCGtAmse5c,"I had a Galaxy A02S for four years until the battery finally died, and just got one of these from Straight Talk for $60 yesterday. 

No comparison whatsoever. They've definitely been working on the A-Series since back then... If you're used to shopping around the $50 price mark for phones, this thing is incredible!"
fFCGtAmse5c,I have it for some time now and while the screen is excellent the overall design is horrible. They put the power button on the side barely extruding so it's extremely hard to click it. Most of the time I need to look where is the button before clicking it. It's a shame because such a small thing is so frustrating. Can't wait to get rid of it unfortunately.
fFCGtAmse5c,"just ordered this phone in light blue too, im so excited for it to come in!!! <3 im using a zte Blade A7P (2021) rn lol im finally upgrading after so long :) my phone struggles to run tiktok so i hope this phone can at least do that :) plus i love the color i got/the model design of it <33 and i can finally get CUTE  cases for the a15 lollooll"
fFCGtAmse5c,Im getting this phone next week
fFCGtAmse5c,"Does it have ""Data switching and backup calling""?"
fFCGtAmse5c,I would've gotten this color for my mom. But we would've had to wait till Friday to get it into best buy. (For the phone a couple days ago) We got her the dark blue. Both are still beautiful. I'll think more about color when they get better rugged clear cases as my mom needs it to protect hers more since she doesn't use screen protectors
fFCGtAmse5c,"Again, the fact that Samsung has an SD card here but not on their $1,000 phone is a travesty."
fFCGtAmse5c,Awesome Phone I am Getting This One Next Month
