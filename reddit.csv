GalaxyA15,Does Samsung Swap Kernels?
GalaxyA15,"It's rare but can happen, more so on devices with the 6-7 years of OS updates as the kernels are not supported for that long"
GalaxyA15,Anyone who has used a foreign ROM on the Galaxy A15 5G
GalaxyA15,YouTube premium and others
GalaxyA15,The phone dose not have enough ram so it's putting the other apps to sleep so it can run as quickly as possible
GalaxyA15,Apps Launch in Pocket
GalaxyA15,"yes, but mine doesn't open apps, it just calls 911 several times a week"
GalaxyA15,my solution is keep it in a holster case
GalaxyA15,"Support had me disable double-tap and lift options. Also showed me Settings-General Management-Network Reset of which I wasn’t aware despite going through what I thought were all menus and watching videos.

UPDATE: Screen shots still made and stored, and apps launched but Data Saver blocks activity. Now burning through data."
GalaxyA15,"Hello all, can somebody explain why this media picker keeps running in the background? This started happening after recent security update which I did in March-25. This is A15 5G 8GB/128GB version running on OneUI 6.1 from India"
GalaxyA15,"My a15 also has battery drain issues. Used up 7% charge within 20 mins as we speak. OneUI 6.1 made things worse for my battery life. 

Regarding the media picker thingy, even my phone shows it with a less than 1m screen time. Maybe it is a common thing? Sorry if irrelevant."
GalaxyA15,Problem with a15 5g
GalaxyA15,return to stock.
GalaxyA15,Do you remember your CSC? For example EUX/OXM?
GalaxyA15,"on ur box it should tell u the csc, go to samfw and search up the model number n then select the right csc and just install via odin3 it should get everything back to normal"
GalaxyA15,Galaxy A15
GalaxyA15,"i would not get the 4gb version.

i would opt for a A30 series at the very least."
GalaxyA15,Get at least a 6 GB variant. 4 gigs wont be enough.
GalaxyA15,"May I ask of those not liking the A15, what apps are you using that make you dislike the phone?"
GalaxyA15,"Sorry, late to the party. I'd say if you haven't bought the phone yet, do yourself a favor and get another phone. This phone is not worth your money."
GalaxyA15,One UI 7 for SM-A155F
GalaxyA15,"first off, is it dangerous, and second, is this illegal?"
GalaxyA15,Nobody leaks M's. That's what's out 🥲
GalaxyA15,"Just wait for June stable release, it's not that deep"
GalaxyA15,"will i be able to directly get updates through OTA afterwards, or will i have to sideload them manually in the future?"
GalaxyA15,Does it need to flash EUX BYC2 for the SD Card method?
GalaxyA15,JUST UPDATED ALREADY
GalaxyA15,"Mine said April on security patch, was just updated today."
GalaxyA15,check my post
GalaxyA15,You have the march security patch 😭😭 I am stuck at February
GalaxyA15,Galaxy A15 any good?
GalaxyA15,"For day to day tasks, it's absolutely fine. I have 8/128 (Region: BD) version and it can handle what I need it to do. And for game, any Supercell game if you're into strategy games. I play Chess so that can be an option."
GalaxyA15,The beach buggy racing and beach buggy racing 2
GalaxyA15,The only game I play and recommend is Cod Mobile. It's a pretty big game that takes huge storage and resources but surprisingly I get decent enough performance on my A15
GalaxyA15,Keep an eye on the size of the cache for the chrome app. For some reason it got up to 4 gigs on my phone before I cleared it. A week later it's already hogging over 2g.
GalaxyA15,My A15 5G Runs better than my A16 5G. I upgraded to the A16 and everything seems slower. So maybe they got it right with the A15 and screwed it up on the A16.
GalaxyA15,"It's a great phone unless you want to game.
The lag is there though.

I was surprised by what they put in a $250 dollar phone"
GalaxyA15,Course I got an fe even though I was happy with it
GalaxyA15,fuck no. I can't do basic shit like bring up the keyboard while watching youtube in the background it's that bad. I literally want to snap it in half.
GalaxyA15,what other phones are better than the Galaxy A15 5G?
GalaxyA15,"Technically the A16 5G, realisticly go for A35 refurbished on Amazon."
GalaxyA15,I consider myself a heavy user but set it to do a forced restart once a week. Never used the built in antivirus but do use malwarebytes. I check the apps for bloated cache once in a while. Found chrome had 4G stored recently so I cleared it. Have had the A15 for about a year after retiring my S8. Quite happy with it.
GalaxyA15,What is your heavy use and what do you mean by lag and how does that occur?
GalaxyA15,"same phone, same issue. got mine in august 2024.

i reset it last week and it's running a lot better."
GalaxyA15,Every phone I've had before this one.
GalaxyA15,Reset my A15 and it runs much better.
GalaxyA15,did you back up anything?
GalaxyA15,Just got a a15 for a camra for youtube
GalaxyA15,The camera on an a15 is okay ik this cause I have one just keep them clean and the videos and pictures should be good.
GalaxyA15,I have the same color!
GalaxyA15,One UI 7 Release Date for A15
GalaxyA15,"I was under the impression the A15 or A16 would get it in 2026 lol. Interesting  
international varients will get the update probably a month or two earlier than US, ect."
GalaxyA15,June I think
GalaxyA15,"Don't care about UI-7. They need to give us regular security updates before any crap they announced for news headline.

What's up with no updates on all the US carrier's A15 5G models (SM-A156U/SM-S156V) for a few months already. Still on Jan,25 security patch level. WTH is happening?

SM-A156U1 already have updates to March, 25 patch level."
GalaxyA15,"Will a A15 originally on Straight Talk, but migrated to SafeLink (still a Tracfone brand) still receive the update? I assume since it received a software update today with April security patches that it will. But Ui 6 to 7 is a major update."
GalaxyA15,trying to transfer vids from A15 to macbook with USB C
GalaxyA15,WARNING: Do NOT waste your money on the A15
GalaxyA15,"Interesting. I don't have any problems, what configuration  do you have and is there specific usage or apps when this occurs?"
GalaxyA15,"I've had no issues with mine.  I run lots of apps, including the pigs, Outlook, Teams, Slack under a work profile.  

There are a lot of phones going by the label ""Samsung A15"".  I have the SM-A155M/DSN, 6G RAM, LTE only and the MediaTek SOC.  I restart every 2 weeks or so, when the touch screen seems to get glitchy."
GalaxyA15,Is yours the Exynos chip version or Mediatek?
GalaxyA15,And I thought the system UI failure was just me 😅
GalaxyA15,Yeah this phone is the cheapest phone you can get pretty much. I think this biggest problem with the phone is the lack of ram. It only has 4gb and in 2024/2025 that’s just not enough. Almost all budget phones have this problem. It worked as a backup phone but it was slow and sluggish at times. 
GalaxyA15,Try resetting and remove unnecessary apps. Mine is the lowest configuration (4gb/128gb 4G LTE) and i even play games on it and it rarely lags on me.
GalaxyA15,"I have all these problems you mentioned, I'm almost dying of hate"
GalaxyA15,I will see of this is gona happen to me by dailying my camra phone (the a15) and i will report back maybe
GalaxyA15,The phone has a bug. Try restarting once a day until you can get the virus checked out. Install Norton 360 afterward. My advice is scrap the phone. Purchase an S24 plus mint condition for $600 on Ebay or Swappa. Proceed to do the former to a phone that's worth something.
GalaxyA15,Microphone problem
GalaxyA15,Maybe mic holes are dirty? Try cleaning with a dry toothbrush
GalaxyA15,Samsung Gallery Studio
GalaxyA15,"I don't have this in my A15 as well but I have it in my A35. I think since A15 is considered a budget phone, the devs don't provide that studio thing for it? I have looked in Google but found nothing. But there goes my guess."
GalaxyA15,What's the machine called that easily install screen protectors with no bubbles
GalaxyA15,"There are tempered glass kits that come with plastic alignment guides that make installation a cinch. Just make sure you are in a clean area, especially if you have pets. Gonna be hard to not get bubbles.. if you look closely that bubble is actually a trapped piece of dander or airborne lint.

I had severe issues when I was at my girlfriend's house. She knits and had two dogs.. airborne particulates was an understatement. Had to install tempered glass at my place.

https://a.co/d/fbp2Uwd  <-- Amazon link to a kit for reference"
GalaxyA15,Clean your phone well...Align the top lower the rest of the glass into the guide. It will self adhere almost perfectly.. press any bubbles out the sides using a bank or credit card wrapped in cleaning cloth
GalaxyA15,Is this a bug?
GalaxyA15,?
GalaxyA15,"Are you saying the image moves or the screen moves?
The screen shouldn't move."

GalaxyA15,"Me, I fell from the second floor and my cell phone was left intact and it was an A15."
GalaxyA15,"I slipped on ice today while walking dogs, phone in back pocket and I thought for sure it would have cracked the screen, but it's completely fine!"
GalaxyA15,When is one ui 7 releasing for A15 5G
GalaxyA15,"Brother, if it's still in beta and the S24 ultra doesn't even have it, the less you expect it for an A15"
GalaxyA15,"Probably in a few months, after the S series devices have gotten it, maybe April or May I would guess."
GalaxyA15,Summer. Imo.
GalaxyA15,Custom rom for a15
GalaxyA15,How is that custom ROM?
GalaxyA15,"can't remember if the A15s have a mediaTek SOC or a Snapdragon SOC

pretty sure that the a15s are running a Snapdragon SoC which is famous for not having any custom ROM support due to the fact that the bootloaders on Snapdragon Samsung's are not user unlockable....

most phones with mediatek SoC dont have ROM support because mediatek in general is not very custom ROM friendly"
GalaxyA15,"The A15 4G has a metiatek chip, sadly no custom roms are available"
GalaxyA15,Bro did you found any ? I also want to improve my a15 4g gaming performance
GalaxyA15,App closing
GalaxyA15,Restart the phone and install Norton 360 or McAfree virus software. Your phone has a cold.
GalaxyA15,This happens on my A10 every so often.
GalaxyA15,"My A15 began glitching where only videos such as IG tiktok etc and even when recording videos, it shows green. Anyone else had this problem? I have to switch off the phone and turn it back on to work again"
GalaxyA15,I hope I don't have this problem on my future Galaxy A15
GalaxyA15,Everyone On Earth Bought THIS Samsung Phone (A15 Full Review)
GalaxyA15,Freezes screen
GalaxyA15,"Install anti malware software like Norton 360 or McAfree.
Pay for the premium service. The phone is a computer. And all computers need anti-virus software."
GalaxyA15,Slow Charging 
GalaxyA15,"Purchase a 25w-45w charger at Walmart for $20. If it still doesn't fast charge, the phone is broken and should be retired."
GalaxyA15,"Yup, the same happened to me when I just got the phone. I was using an old charger that I already had. I changed it to a 45W charger, and it started working normally again. 

I'm currently using a fake charger that I bought for $10, but I'm thinking of changing it though"
GalaxyA15,"I'm using an old Samsung 2 speed charger and cable from my S8 and have ""low speed / 80%"" charging rates selected. 
From a 35% battery level it will take about 60 or 70 minutes to reach 80% charge. If I change to 100%  it will charge in less than 90 minutes. If I select high speed charging, it charges about 20% faster but feels slightly warm after the fact. Low speed charging and charging to 80% is kinder to your battery.
Using a generic charger and/or a crappy cable can show a 3 hour recharge rate. The phone tries to protect itself if it detects non standard power."
GalaxyA15,"You can try altering your settings to low mode and changing the notifications and apps and systems.

Change a power outlet you use.
Chances are you have bug/virus. Bring it to a person who specializes in computing or phones. Above it guys if you can find a reliable person you trust with encrypting and or decrypting.

Restart your phone regularly or at last resort buy a new one. Can get for under 199.
I had wonky charging with a mind of its own. Maybe your phone is a bad batch in the android super AI(r)compute.
My response is Subjective. Take it as is for you is as it's given."
GalaxyA15,Bad cable ?
GalaxyA15,"12 megapixel and 50 megapixel mode, what's the initial difference?"
GalaxyA15,U probably should use it in 12mp mode bcs that way ur sensor will combine its pixels to increase the light information and give you better results. But these are my assumptions so don't believe me completely.(and again using a lover mp mode should give your processor easier time to work on the picture itself)
GalaxyA15,A15 camera criticism?
GalaxyA15,Personally I don't take photos but there decent and such a cutie pie here but yeah bugjet camera does the job
GalaxyA15,It's good for Face Value photos but if you want to zoom in and look at individual things in the pictures then you can clearly tell that it is a shitty camera but just looking normally it looks good
GalaxyA15,The hate on the A15?
GalaxyA15,its a good phone
GalaxyA15,"Yes, it's a budget phone, but probably the best budget phone out there.  Compared to the Moto g power it replaced it has better reception (I work from home and am rural) and far nicer cameras (wide and macro cameras).    
I could afford an S-series but don't see the point."
GalaxyA15,I'm with you. It's a solid phone and does everything I want it to. It replaced my S8 and the dying battery. I miss the nice hand feel of the S8's curved screen but with a knock off otterbox defender this does everything as well or faster than the 8. Cheap too.
GalaxyA15,The camera is not good on the phone. The camera on a nearly 10 year old S5 was world's ahead of the 1080 display on the A15.
GalaxyA15,"A15 8gb RAM/256gb Storage user here. This is the first time i've used a budget Samsung phone (with an ARM CPU/Mali GPU) and in my opinion it's not bad at all. I mainly use this as an emulation device, still i have no complaints at all (other than the mono speakers). It can emulate games from Atari 2600 up to PS2 which is quite impressive for a device that does not have a Snapdragon chipset. I don't use it's camera that much as I'm not a camera geek so i don't really care about the camera quality. For me the camera is just meh. The build quality while screams plastic still feels solid and nice to hold."
GalaxyA15,I bought the new A15 and it won't charge past 88%. Also it does a lot of weird stuff that my A14 didn't. Lagging. Glitching a lot
GalaxyA15,"If you’re going to get the A15, I’d recommend getting the 256GB/8GB model. Personally, it’s a good side by side comparison to the CMF phone 1 in speed. The 4GB RAM model is just too slow for anything. Can’t have no more than 3 apps open when you start experiencing the lag."
GalaxyA15,I love mine. It can be a bit slow at times and lag a little bit but it's very smooth and responsive. It does not lag one bit when I scroll. It's one of the best phones I've ever had.
GalaxyA15,"Hell ,I know what ya mean..All I've seen that are bitching about the A15 is the Big Premium Flagship like S24 or whatever it is..I'm like you man, love it and no problems yet and been a month today. My Motorola Moto 5G Stylus 2023 was a problem..a real Heffer lol"
GalaxyA15,"The only thing I hate about the A15 is that I have the version with 4GB of RAM. Everything else is fine, but I can't believe I can't leave YouTube to answer a message without it losing the video I was watching 🤣"
GalaxyA15,"This phone gets hate poured on it by Redditors.

I read that the average age of a Redditor is 23 and more likely male, with a heavy (55%?) percentage being gamers. My suspicion is that the subreddits on smartphones are even more heavily skewed towards gamers.

The A15 isn't great for hardcore gaming, so the gamers crap all over it.

Any phone that holds up well, lets me access emails, send texts, access the Internet and make calls is great. I don't need a toy, and for games, I'd rather play basketball, soccer or anything that gets me off the couch."
GalaxyA15,"well I'll be honest I had the A33 before this and it got stolen so I got this one but the camera colouring is whack and annoys me so much also IT DOESNT SUPPORT SCREEN RECORDING WTH and for some mystery reason it doesn't seem to support studio in the gallery app which I used all the time for editing videos smh

at least it has a headphone jack tho"
GalaxyA15,Anyone else's A15 poj phone call 911 in their pocket on the lock screen?
GalaxyA15,"you can go in the lock screen settings and remove the button as an option.

I was also having this problem."
GalaxyA15,Samsung Wallet 
GalaxyA15,Internet doesn't work anymore with the last update
GalaxyA15,"For now I solved by selecting 3G/2G in the network settings. I think I will wait for another update, because 5G worked before this update."
GalaxyA15,reset Network settings and reboot
GalaxyA15,December patch?
GalaxyA15,Anyone else having A15 5G GPS tracking problems?
GalaxyA15,"GPS on anything other than an iPhone I've used had accuracy problems. Specifically budget mediatek processors isn't known for its cellular, gps performance. I've used the A15 and it's about the same as every android phone I've used."
GalaxyA15,Yeah me. Sometimes gps signal lost
GalaxyA15,A15 not charging past 88 percent
GalaxyA15,vs A14
GalaxyA15,"The a15 is definitely alot more snappy, you can play music and the phone will still be usable, better camera (0.5). Ts is my opinion having upgraded a week ago lwk on average it's jst as fast but it's alot better under load"
GalaxyA15,A15 5G sometimes   runs   really   slowly 
GalaxyA15,"I’m going to guess here. I only use my a15 as a backup phone so most of the time it sits idle.

It’s probably the 4gb of memory just not enough these days."
GalaxyA15,"I’ve always gotten my phone with 128/6 i have Galaxy A20 32/3 it runs smoothly on Android 10 One UI 2,1 so I’m assuming it’s a Android/system issue mostly bcuz ik frm UI 2,1 until 6,1,1 it’s a lot of Samsung branded apps to not lag with 4 but before even 2 or 3 was more than okay"
GalaxyA15,"I use my A15 as a secondary bc my s20fe just has shit battery but the reason it does that is because your ram is asked to do 2 much and it gets overloaded and it just shuts everything down for a few seconds so it can try again it could also be the same problem but with the chip instead 

My old A12 back when I used it as a primary had the same problem"
GalaxyA15,My a14 did this but my a15 dosent
GalaxyA15,Turn off ram plus

GalaxyA15,A15 5g 4/128gb or A15 8/256gb
GalaxyA15,I would say go for A15 4G (8/256) as the 5G version isn’t that much faster and much of the world still don’t use common 5G so 4G for now it is still
GalaxyA15,"Hi there, well I have the 6gb ram/128 gb version (4g) and it works well for me. Ill say if you have the budget for the 256 gb/8gb 4g model, go for it."
GalaxyA15,"I had gotten the a15 5g with 4g ram and it's pretty slow. When diving from app to app, it lags. Open spotify, lags. Select playlist and then change mind and search artist, device lags. I blame it on the phone itself being several models behind. Not sure if thats the cause thoooo"
GalaxyA15,"as a A15 4/128 user, id get the A15 8/256gb"
GalaxyA15,"Depends on your network.   If t-mobile 5G is often better so I'd get that version.  AT&T or Verizon, I'd just get 4G until they can get their networks up to speed.  And even that could change based on where you live."
GalaxyA15,Chrome pops up in small window automatically 
GalaxyA15,Playing an intensive game for a while causes cell service to stop working.

GalaxyA15,Does a15 have screen recording built in
GalaxyA15,"This isn’t a “ridiculous” question. No, the A15 (4G and 5G) do NOT have screen recording built in. For screen recording, you need a 3rd party app."
GalaxyA15,[removed]
GalaxyA15,"If it's not in the control panel, you don't have that feature."

RELEASES: https://github.com/parallelcc/MiCTS/releases"
GalaxyA15,do you recommend me buying the thing?
GalaxyA15,yes
GalaxyA15,"It's a decent phone, especially for the price. Also, depends on what you're doing. This is perfect for general use. If you plan on photos and videos be aware it doesn't have image stabilization. Videos are going to look shaky if you have a shaky hand (especially with zoomed). It doesn't get super hot if playing a heavy game."
GalaxyA15,Did you get it?
GalaxyA15,Quite happy with the unlocked version from staples who price matched wallymart. I replaced my S8 which had a dying battery. Would get 8g ram if that option was available if doing it again. That version showed up 2w after I bought this one.
GalaxyA15,Blurry MMS
GalaxyA15,"just bought a A15, its great"
GalaxyA15,"Agreed, phone is awesome. Ive spent the last 4 days getting acclimated.  I`m looming for any tips or tricks of the trade, this is my foist android phone"
GalaxyA15,I'm thinking about either this one or a moto power or a google pixel for my next phone. Moto doesn't get glowing reviews and the Pixels are pricey so this might be the one. The only thing I don't really like is the Samsung ecosystem/apps overlap with general android. I have the A51 5G currently which has been a good phone but has reached the end of its support/upgrade life.
