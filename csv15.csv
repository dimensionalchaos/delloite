SuIl1KRWhSc,"A good enough phone for those who just need a basic smartphone with basic usage. Nothing fancy here, but still solid."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"just got the a15 5g ,had it about a week way less glitchy than my old nokia 100 , pretty good for a $150 phone im happy"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I got this phone for the basic smart phone features of apps for grocery shopping, qr code downloads for municipal transportation system real time operations Where is that train or bus? ).  Calculating out the cost savings in shopping with coupons, exceeded the cost upgrades for buying the phone.  It provides the basic phone services and that is all I want tor need from a smart phone."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got A15, 5G today. I like it.."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Good phone. Samsung's budget phones are becoming better. A few comments about the video. First, I'm happy you brought the speaker test sounds back. Second, you forgot about the selfie photo quality. But great review. Looking forward to that of the S24 ultra. Thanks."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Ive been using a15 for 1 month now and it's a great phone
SuIl1KRWhSc,"man headphone jack + microsd is wild to see today, and totally sells me on it"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I bought the s20 fe this week  for the same price, and it's really good ,battery not the best but I'm planing to change it  ,I think buy old good phone better then new cheap phone 😊"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Just bought one of these for my teenage son, his last phone unfortunately tanked. Really brilliant budget smart phone"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"3:30 25W charging is a nice update, but no charger in the box. And I still thank Samsung for saving the world more."
SuIl1KRWhSc,2:03 I'm so happy you brought this banger back♥️👑
SuIl1KRWhSc,I bought this phone a few days ago and theres no complaints ❤😊
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Has been a great work phone, I have an IPhone 15 pro Max for my daily personal but this Samsung was brought as mine for management and so far it's been great for what it is"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I purchased one today and I am very happy. $170 out the door. Does the same thing as all the other Samsung phones, just a little slower. I love the single speaker at bottom. Very loud."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Hooray...Snow This Time... Absolutely Splendid...
SuIl1KRWhSc,My favorite YouTuber by far I watch all of your reviews
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Looking at benchmark results, it can be summed up as ""What if the S9 had a battery?"""
SuIl1KRWhSc,for what its worth at least Samsung is stepping up their official software support game.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Many people just ask if it's this or that... You buy and see a cheap product with many updates, a nice design and a relatively solid memory space. That phone pushes well and works, and whether it has a headphone jack and whether it runs certain games without crashing, it doesn't matter whether it has or doesn't have a headphone jack, there are always headphones with a type C input... For certain games, you buy the S series and you don't complicate it for $200, you can't expect it to applaud you and the battery is saved just like the phone."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"i have a 52s 5g and an A15  4g....so far A15 runs as smoothly as my 52, if you dont overload it with apps, its running fast and smooth as hell..also the 128 gb storage and the 4 gb ram is tremendous for a cheap phone like that- but what is a 10/10 is its battery!!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn. Surveillance quality videos.
SuIl1KRWhSc,For a13 the a15 a real succesor finally
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Ive got this phone to replace my a03..a15 4g is a good phone after a month of usage. Videos, camera, social media, casual gaming are execellent no lag no heating battery is good. I love samsung compare to chinese phones."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Great review of Samsung a24, i mean a15"
SuIl1KRWhSc,It's funny how I watch more reviews from this guy than any other tech YouTuber and I still don't know his full name.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Most people don't use half the shit on their phone. Buying a $2000 phone is ridiculous. This is just fine.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from my brand new A15 im so loving it❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I love that it has a decently modern 6nm chipset, great for battery life, but those AMOLED screens are more of a liability, shadows and more sensitive to impacts. OIS would be nice. The SD card and headphone jack are great."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"3:53 PDAF& OIS, it only has AF, and it also gets 4 years os updates it says on samsung"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Bought Today, Great Phone🎉"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"The Amoled is a big win on these phones.
Only if the A5x would get S-series features too"
SuIl1KRWhSc,just bought this right now from amazon canada for 170$ it'll be here in a few days ill let you know how it went.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Damn that blue looks hot
SuIl1KRWhSc,As a lite user this phone is enough for me
SuIl1KRWhSc,"You only get a charging cable in the box now, not adapter, headphones etc? Haven't bought a new phone since S6."
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just got the 5G version. Replacing my Bricked A51. Overall it's a nice phone.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Using ot right now, its a very good phone for its phone extraordinary value!"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Just upgraded from the A13 and the difference in quality is crazy
SuIl1KRWhSc,Headphone jack and microSD in 2024? On a $120 phone? What a steal!
SuIl1KRWhSc,For a budget phone it looks hella good.
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just purchase this phone on Amazon for $130.00 for a friend in the Caribbean..i think she would be happy with my choice..all she need it to make calls and text and this phone is plenty for her needs..good review by the way
SuIl1KRWhSc,This is similar to a24 and that is amazing 👏 😮
SuIl1KRWhSc,A15 5g is really awesome❤❤.no complaints 🎉🎉
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I want to know if Samsung  A15 will also have Samsung Cloud Back up, like we have on the Flagship Phones"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Good solid phone. Got one for less then $150 with case and it’s worth it.
SuIl1KRWhSc,What is the pulse width modulation level at different brightness levels?  Thank you in advance.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"In your opinion, will this phone be a good alternative for a travel phone? One that mostly is used to take pics, Google Maps, Translate, and to communicate through WhatsApp,Facebook, and use UBER or other transport. apps? I got my normal cell phone  but need a second one just for travel and one that be inexpensive but good enough to manage esim,pics and what we mostly use overseas while traveling."
SuIl1KRWhSc,The bezels are iconic 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,Nice review
SuIl1KRWhSc,3:57 There's no OIS.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching this in my Samsung A70 from 2019😂
SuIl1KRWhSc,This is my new phone because i lost my old phone and it's good
SuIl1KRWhSc,"The general performance is not the best, but what a beauty the Amoled screen and many future updates are. However, we hope that the software is optimized properly, otherwise it will become unusable"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Can you include walking video test in the future?
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Hello Will, please help me.  I want to know where I can buy the same earrings you have in this videos...? 🙏🏼"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching from A15❤❤
SuIl1KRWhSc,"""These low end budget devices keep getting better and better"". I love how they find a way to praise and demean simultaneously in the same sentence.🤣"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Bro you have mixed some features of 4G and 5G versions.
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks for posting this video.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"no deep camera/video test, i just finished with this channel"
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this phone. 6gb ram really makes butter smooth.
SuIl1KRWhSc,I have this and don't mind it
SuIl1KRWhSc,Watching  it on my a35 5g  looking  good
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks Samsung top notch until 2030
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I bought this phone as 2nd phone. It's good enough for basic usage. Good battery life, amoled screen, casual gaming. It also has smartview for streaming your phone to TV. But, the camera quality is average."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Are you able to hide the notch like the old times?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Waooo... Going to get it immediately
SuIl1KRWhSc,I got the 5g version today!!
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Did not mention that this phone does not have timelapse camera option. Purely softwarily limited, probably so people would buy expensive phone instead."
SuIl1KRWhSc,Please make a full review of the s24 plus I'm thinking of Pre order
SuIl1KRWhSc,Does this phone has call recording option without informing the call reciever?
SuIl1KRWhSc,I am dying  to know if this is the last samsung phone ever not to have 5g network... what do you think?.. please answer..
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Can this phone be used in the USA with a SIM from a network outside the USA?
My phone that I was using for my congo sim broke down. and I wanted to buy this Samsung A15 for my congo sim. will it work? note that I am in the USA. THANKS"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"How can a 200€ phone have more functions than a 1500€ one? Phone jack? Expandable storage? FM radio? Sure S24 has some stuff thats more advanced, but you never use it...  the really usable stuff is missing..."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I've got this phone around 3 months back it's very good phone and I recommend it, if you're you're using it for the connection 4G solid Choice especially with this range price which considerable cheap."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Cellphone is supposed to be a Telephone First. I bought the Samsung A15 after watching this review. and found after getting my 5G Sim card, the ear speaker sound quality very Tinny. I wished the reviewer had tested the A15 for ear speaker sound quality. I replaced my, lower priced,  Moto G pure worked great as a phone! The A15 demo phone did not have a Sim card so i could not hear the ear speaker quality. I guess I have to live with it.."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"I am very regreting not buying Samsung a15,i buyed redmi note 12 and its camera is very bad"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Looking for a suggestion from anyone knowledgeable:

I would like to buy this version of a15 4g with 8gb ram, I found a deal for 150€, I'm concerned about not having 5G connection in the future.

Should I not care about it and just buy it or wait for a16 instead?"
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Bought Samsung A15 and I must say that for the price, its worth it. I bought 8/256 variant, camera performs well in good lightening conditions especially the front one and back camera 50mp does a good job even with a flashlight only. Charging speed has improved and battery works really well, I was expecting 4G+ support on this one but unfortunately it doesn't support that, guess that's the only con. The rest, it will work well for couple of years with 4 major updates and 5 years patches. ;)"
SuIl1KRWhSc,What is memory type?
SuIl1KRWhSc,The new battery life score is confusing to look at unless you compare it to phones that has both the old and the new scores on their site.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"a24 or a15 
please advise which one is better"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Which phone will be a step up from this one? Without upping price very much. I need better camera than the A15.
SuIl1KRWhSc,It has the exact same external build as the A55?
SuIl1KRWhSc,is this ok for riders/drivers who uses waze or delivery/ride-hauling apps?
SuIl1KRWhSc,I haven't seen an Angie video in forever 😢 Is she still at GSMArena?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Am going to buy a 15 very soon 😅
SuIl1KRWhSc,I like way he present  phone and review
SuIl1KRWhSc,I just ordered one of amazon like 5 mins ago
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Are they compatible with apps update? For example, would Facebook stop working on this phone if the app had an upgrade?"
SuIl1KRWhSc,Tremenda maquina gran capacidad y incluso mas rapido que el a35
SuIl1KRWhSc,U got it wrong it has 4 yrs os update and 5 yrs security
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Would've gotten this over the Redmi but the bezel and notch turned me off..that shit is ugly in 2024. I got the Redmi and I love every single of it. And it's BEZELLESS.

After seeing this review, thankfully I spent on a better device."
SuIl1KRWhSc,perfect phone to buy for your parents
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thank you 🙏
SuIl1KRWhSc,Can it still work until 6-8 years?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Is ingress protection like gorilla glass? Does it have gorilla glass protection?
SuIl1KRWhSc,Thanks Redmi. Without you Samsung would not have pushed Amoled screens to that segment.
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Samsung is a multi-billion dollar company, I can't see why they opted to use ""Virtual proximity sensing"" in their cheaper phones, actual physical sensors have worked so well for years and costs nothing to implement, Virtual proximity sensing is a complete non starter."
SuIl1KRWhSc,"Can you do A15 4G vs A24 4G, as well as A25 5G vs A34 5G and A15 5G vs A23 5G? The A24 and A15 are not fully identical."
