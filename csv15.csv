Usvu6GLvo6U,I'm using the A15 5g for a month now. No real complaints.
Usvu6GLvo6U,A15 is an emulation beast too. Can play 90% of the legal roms you own for the ps2 and everything before ps2 runs at perfectly.
Usvu6GLvo6U,I just bought an A15 for $60 bucks on marketplace from some rich family in the north imei was good and everything.
Usvu6GLvo6U,"No headphone jack on the A16 🤔, I'll stick with my A15"
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I have the a15 4g. Great display, battery life, headphone jack, stable OS, software support is good, especially for the price. My only complaint is that the phone is big. I wish they made budget phones at 6 inches."
Usvu6GLvo6U,I have a 16 5g but it has mediatek 6300 it's very good for gaming
Usvu6GLvo6U,Got mine this week love the A/series samsung galaxy's my favorite phones they are great for my business
Usvu6GLvo6U,I have A11 and I am still wondering to this day how come all its predecessors have teardrop notch? One reason I am still 50/50 on upgrading 😞.
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Definitely NOT worth it, the A16 doesn't have a headphone jack, to all A15 owners, stick with your current phone (unless you wanna upgrade to a Samsung A2X i.e. A25 or A26), the Samsung A15 is perfect as it is.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not saying that the Samsung Galaxy A16 is a bad phone, it's definitely awesome. 😊 But if you're more old school and love auxiliary cables, wired headphones or earphones, then this phone is not for you, however if you have Bluetooth headphones, Samsung airpods, a Bluetooth car radio (for listening to music in your car) then by all means, go ahead and get the A16! But only if you can survive without having a headphone jack! 😂😅"
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Simply go for the A16 you will never regret,  dont look donw on the audio jack🎉🎉"
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I'll be upgrading to 1 of these 2 from a A03s so in comparison I doubt that personally I'll find anything ""disappointing"" heh"
Usvu6GLvo6U,Which is best sound quality
Usvu6GLvo6U,"This was an unfair comparison because the A16 has 8GB of RAM while the A15 has only 4GB of RAM. The A16 will have better performance going back and forth between apps.
In the United States you can only get 4GB of RAM with either of these models."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I have the A16, I'll be back after I did my emulators. But exenos has ALWAYS been horrible for me since a10."
Usvu6GLvo6U,You just have to turn off the animation and other gimmicks in developer mode. Phone runs snappy
Usvu6GLvo6U,"BRING BACK THE HEADPHONE JACK
BRING BACK THE HEADPHONE JACK"
Usvu6GLvo6U,I got my a15 completely free at Walmart when I bought my 45$ monthly plan from straight talk.
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I just got the A 16 no phone jack,but it's a little powerful phone"
Usvu6GLvo6U,I rather go with the A16
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Talking about the A15 being slow.
Could it run google maps and play spotify in the background without turning spoitfy off, or when switching back to spotify stop the navigation? Or run Android Auto at all.
My A41 can't, it insta closes any ""bigger"" app when i turn on something else. And never really uses all 4Gb of ram it's apparently got."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"The teardrop notch should be irradicated, it makes the bezel worse and makes the phone look dated."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Okay i want to buy my mom present for her b-day. And I’m thinking between these two, but i’m not sure which one to get?"
Usvu6GLvo6U,Which one has the best camera?
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Is vice-versa, dude... A15 has a glossy back."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"I just bought the A15 5G at Target for $75, but I haven't opened or activated it yet and can return it.  Should I keep it, or should I return it and buy the A16 5G for $150?"
Usvu6GLvo6U,I brought my a16 from the Samsung shop for £169 which I think is a bit to cheap especially for the 5g version
Usvu6GLvo6U,Kun sa best h 15 ya 16
Usvu6GLvo6U,The a16 5g dosnt seem to have really any difference from the a15 5g....yes a few things are different but....I mean not to me worth calling an upgrade they could have just gave an update to the a15 5g for the difference (well not the hardware obviously)
Usvu6GLvo6U,"Nice comparison. My opinion on these two is that the A16 is worse than the A15 in every way other than its update policy. 

The A16 has weird extremely uneven bezels, dropped the headphone jack, too big and has way worse battery drain than the A15.

None of the A1x series are fast thats to be expected. If the A15 had the dual sim with sd card tray like the A14 did it would be near budget perfection. 

Im not sure why the A16 was released, the A15 didnt even get its full year."
Usvu6GLvo6U,"They're both the same phone except the following....
16 is larger height wise
16 no headphone jack
16 screen fingerprint sensor



Other than that.... Same phone."
Usvu6GLvo6U,Would the a15 5g better then the a15 base?
Usvu6GLvo6U,I have an a15 5g and I like it...I wanted the a25 5g But at the time my provider didn't support it (the day I bought the a15 when I was adding it to my phone account the listed it as a supported phone lol go figure..... I am surprised though that samsung hasn't Really put any advertising into the a16 5g As in there's literally nothing about it on their website it's not even listed for sale
Usvu6GLvo6U,A16 lost me at the headphone jack
Usvu6GLvo6U,I like the A16 because it doesn't have the jack so I'll upgrade from my a15 to that
Usvu6GLvo6U,This phone is sf slippery it slides out of your grip every chance it gets
Usvu6GLvo6U,Them reviews really fooled me that a15 was literal laggy garbagé
Usvu6GLvo6U,Dude already damaged it lol frame scuffed
Usvu6GLvo6U,"These type of phones were made for 3rd world countries, that's why they gave all these cheap android phones the galaxy tag, so that people can brag that they have a galaxy phone. I personally think it was a bad business move because it brings down the galaxy name."
Usvu6GLvo6U,Is it any good compared to 2023 Samsung galaxy A14 5G
