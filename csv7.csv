pm9CYCllfFg,"Love the traditional headphone jack, sd card."
pm9CYCllfFg,I pimped out my galaxy a155g..shit is way better and faster than how i bought it
pm9CYCllfFg,Outstanding Video! Just got a A15 & amazed at its capabilities. You are GREAT!...How about another Vid showing  'How to Transfer from Contacts List into 'Groups'. I can't get this to work....Thanks
pm9CYCllfFg,Is there any way to bring the screenshot icon like to the bottom of the phone? So its easier? I can't find the icon you clicked so fast 😔
pm9CYCllfFg,What a great video. Fort Tsing android.  Lots to customize
pm9CYCllfFg,thank you for this video
pm9CYCllfFg,"Almost every single one of these was something new for me. And I actually changed at least 10 different things. But do you think you could make a video showing us how to change the character symbols' locations? On my keyboard, I hate that the question mark is so far away from the exclamation mark. On my old phone, it used to be right next to each other, but now they're on opposite sides of the keyboard. I know where in the settings it says to change it, but every time I try doing it, it's just really confusing, and I end up not changing anything."
pm9CYCllfFg,I found this very helpful but I have a question for you. I installed a micro sd card but I can't figure out how to transfer the pictures and videos that my wife has on her phone to it. How is that done?
pm9CYCllfFg,"Watched, but barely see the phone screen."
pm9CYCllfFg,These are things that come with the phone.You figure it out on your own

pm9CYCllfFg,Thinking of upgrading from a Pixel 3 to this! Looks so good for free (with xfinity)
pm9CYCllfFg,"Hi got this phone about 6 months ago ,but i can not get it to notify me of a voice mail . talk to straight talk they looked at there settings  said things was ok on there side . would you have any ideals what it might be ?"
pm9CYCllfFg,"Please, please, please can you help me? 1st of all I can do things however I need talking through it from start to finish, as you have brilliantly done in this video, and thanks for that. Right, how on earth do I get the phone to stop leaving (for E.G.) the 'Copied to clipboard' on the screen in the small grey box, it happens with other things also. I just can't get rid of it and it drives me mad! And another issue, how can you access the clipboard? Thanks in advance, MAH."
pm9CYCllfFg,"Mr. Butler,
Hope all is well. After watching your video on the A15, I  was  so convinced as to which phone I was going to purchase...however when I  went to the Samsung website, I basically got talked out of the A15, and into the A25. PLEASE, I need your help/opinion/advice because I am older and not very tech savvy. I have scoured YouTube looking to see if you had a video similar to this one about the A15 but giving a review of the A25. PLEASE HELP,  I need to make my decision soon. Thx in advance 😊"
pm9CYCllfFg,What does the button on the left with a small hole on the top of it do?
