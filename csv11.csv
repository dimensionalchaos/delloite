N5TvRBS6wxg,The first one was sooo helpful already oh my god. I always have problems sending more than 2 pictures or long videos. Thank you so much!
N5TvRBS6wxg,"Another good one I always use is called ""Classic Keyboard."" Just simple straightforward keyboard types, and you can choose the size of keyboard, and best of all, the size of the INDIVIDUAL KEYS too. So if you (and your eyes) are getting older, this is a great one to use. 👍👍"
N5TvRBS6wxg,"Common sense instructions,  great flow,  a little slower for the seasoned viewers.  I saved to watch on my laptop.  ❤I came here looking for widgets and learned so much more.  Thanks"

N5TvRBS6wxg,"Be aware that the A15 is NOT hearing aid compatible. Just found out the hard way bought this model to replace an elderly A21s for more storage and better screen . The A21s is compatible I ,thought that all galaxy phones were not so. Perhaps Samsung could do an update for A15s to incorporate hearing aid support. I found a workarabound if you have a baha 6 and a minimic you can stream via the mic as there is a 3.5mm jack incorporated in it and you can plug a 3.5mm to 3.5mm lead to the phone bit cumbersome but it works."
