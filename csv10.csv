KzRwyqCWDnI,"I put my hand over my new (A15) phone and said ""shhhh~ don't look, baby"" 💀 Knowing me, it WILL shatter in the first couple of months of me using it"
KzRwyqCWDnI,Me watching on my SAMASUNG GALAXY A15
KzRwyqCWDnI,My mother literally threw her A22 4g with force of maybe 60N and it is still fresh
KzRwyqCWDnI,1:49 so funny 😂😂😂
KzRwyqCWDnI,I accidentally kicked my phone (a15) and it went around 7 feet on hard ground before hitting a door. Still unscathed (it had a case btw)
KzRwyqCWDnI,"I dropped my phone like 20 times on purpose, and it didn't crack at all (a15 user)"
KzRwyqCWDnI,"What is it made of is clear now, thin mirror and plastic from polybag"
KzRwyqCWDnI,My A15 screen shattered after it fell down from less than one foot height. This is absolutely the worst phone I have ever bought in my entire life
KzRwyqCWDnI,"I have a case with built in protector to stop this ! Also im not planning on dropping it lol, but for £150 THATS decent for basic social media and texts and calls and when u get a new phone u can just use it as a spare"
KzRwyqCWDnI,ngl this was painful to watch
KzRwyqCWDnI,"Moto G 5G has equal durability.
I only need a phone for calls/texts/gewguhling.
I learned that if one is gonna buy a cheap, better buy a quality case."
KzRwyqCWDnI,When are we gonna get the Samsung A16 durability test😢😢
KzRwyqCWDnI,5days too go for my Samsung a15
KzRwyqCWDnI,I recommend a screen protector
KzRwyqCWDnI,"it s a very slippery phone as well,also thin glass"
KzRwyqCWDnI,"Brother😢I will always use 2 tempered glass on my A15, it is void of cgg😭😱"
KzRwyqCWDnI,"Durability test❌️
Wasting money✅️"
KzRwyqCWDnI,It's not LCD it is AMOLED screen
KzRwyqCWDnI,Maybe it just me but ive droped so many times higher falls to and it has never cracked for the time ive had it
KzRwyqCWDnI,The screen shattered so easy why
KzRwyqCWDnI,Don't waste your money❤😅by breaking a phone
KzRwyqCWDnI,my samsung galaxy s6 fall 100 time and never broken
KzRwyqCWDnI,"When it comes to screen durability, redmi is the best.
Don't you think?"
KzRwyqCWDnI,0:07 очень быстро
KzRwyqCWDnI,my friend have a strongest drop and nothing happened😂
KzRwyqCWDnI,Watching on my a15 and continously murmuring don't do it...
KzRwyqCWDnI,I feel bad for the phone😢
KzRwyqCWDnI,A15 is main phone and i dropped it off my glass table and not a scratch
KzRwyqCWDnI,"I think i got it, one con of galaxy A1x is no  protection"
KzRwyqCWDnI,the phone is wet ofcorse it will break easier
KzRwyqCWDnI,That's odd cuz I dropped it 5 feet and it didn't shatter
KzRwyqCWDnI,Mine got rolled over by a Car yesterday and it was completely fine idk If it was the case or just the Phone bit it somehow survived and both wheels got over the screen
KzRwyqCWDnI,Oppo k12x is best❤️❤️
