bCSiFL3PdsA,What are your thoughts on my take?
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Nothing can beat their software and camera for this price though
A15 is currently the best and most value for money budget phone for it's price"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I will never use a Tecno or infinix ever again in my life, it's all hype, their phones are always buggy"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Not bad fr, I'd pick Samsung over Tecno"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"It's not just specs
if people could pay an extra $20-$40 for 5years of software update on a tecno or infinix they probably would
samsung also has better build quality, better software, better experience and confidence in the brand name
the resale value of a samsung is better too."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I will still buy Samsung because of 4 Year software 
up to Android 18 and people say bad Tecno software 😐"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"whatever the situation. Samsung is what I'll always choose. Whichever variety you purchase, you will find excellent use for it. 🎉"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"The fact that it a tecno phone,  it kind of ""devalue"" the phone ...
People will still buy the samsung bcos of brand name"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Don't compare tecno to the legendary samsung
bCSiFL3PdsA,My opinion I would still pick samsung tecno software is not good
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Why avoid Samsung Galaxy A25 and Galaxy A15? Most likely because these two models have 
3.5 mm headphone jacks and the majority of Samsung phones now are upper end ones with no 3.5 mm headphone jacks. I was told by some sales people that  Samsung is pushing mostly expensive phones without 3.5 mm headphone jacks so you can buy their bluetooth ear buds etc., some very expensive. I have three Samsung phones A14 4g and A15 5g and I absolutely love them!!  I get to use my regular headsets- no thanks to earbuds as well."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Software tramples Hardware all the time. With a samsung phone like a15 you will get until android 18. With tecno you will stay on android 13 for as long as you have the phone meaning you will be outdated for a while. A tecno can come with a curved screen, 65W charging speed but I'd still take a Samsung with a u-shaped notch and a 25w charger. I do not hate tecno or infinix or other specs-filled devices competing with samsung but I have never heard someone say that it was the best phone they have ever had."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Hello Oscar, i think you're actually speaking my mind...i'm about to purchase this phone but that notch is so annoying....I'm still contemplating getting it..i wouldn't know something so insignificant in my opinion is really annoying me😂😂"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Im using Samsung A15, and it's good for me, samsung will always be the best android phone"
bCSiFL3PdsA,They don't provide the extras to reduce the amount of junk filling our landfills. Most people already have one or more chargers and better headphones than the ones often supplied. I'm happy to just get the phone and cable to help reduce pollution.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"For the price , the A25 is a decent smartphone,  much better than a13 phone"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I have been using Huawei phones all my life, I recently purchased my first Samsung phone and I'm not disappointed at all although I would have preferred to continue the streak of Huawei phones"
bCSiFL3PdsA,But still samsung can definitely do better at least give us back a charger with every phone instead they choose to leave it out of the box.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Samsung software is stable and reliable. Also, updates are guaranteed for at least 3 years for budget phones. Tecno and the rest have crappy software, and support is very limited. Not to mention the annoying pop-ups and advertisements."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Samsung really like to overprice the mid range phones, they need to do better"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung made thick frames and notch on purpose so that the customers consider more expensive models
bCSiFL3PdsA,A15 is de'baddest. Did you say Tecno? I upgraded from Infinix to Samsung.
bCSiFL3PdsA,Remember the times when all samsung deviced got free cool in-ear headphones with the phone?
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I was choosing between samsung Galaxy a15 8/256 and realme 11 8/256. Taking into account the price of the samsung charging unit and the case, the price was the same. As a result, I liked Samsung more and bought it yesterday"
bCSiFL3PdsA,It is the higher tier phone from last year at a lower price with minimal diferences.
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung have good software better than tecno.Warranty is longer as well.
bCSiFL3PdsA,i cant buy any of those because of that front camera design am fed up of seeing it
bCSiFL3PdsA,"As someone who owns an A24, I'm not compelled to get any of these phones."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"First of all you're talking too fast 2nd of all you didn't tell us what is bad about the phones I think they are ok you didn't point out anything that's really bad about them for the price you pay.
The A 15 is a cracking phone for its money. I don't understand your gripe"
bCSiFL3PdsA,How would you compare the A15 vs S21
bCSiFL3PdsA,man this mobile will be upgradable to android 18. that a reason to buy
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Hwve my sight set on the A54 5G i hate tear drop notch, plus the new phones are just too big"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Recently I purchased Galaxy A25 but front camera very very poor    I cantact Samsung care they are not helping  please don't buy
bCSiFL3PdsA,I love the teardrop notch.
bCSiFL3PdsA,I was expecting something bad but those are things we can ignore but without a doubt I'm still sticking with Samsung
bCSiFL3PdsA,It's the choice not that they are better than techno infinix and oppo. In fact itel is doing better.
bCSiFL3PdsA,I can pic Samsung because of up to 4 -5  of years software
bCSiFL3PdsA,I like that wallpaper how can get it?
bCSiFL3PdsA,"I am sucker for amoled screens, my phone broke and i want to get a repalcement ( i dont mind used even). In your opinion, whats the best phone to get till i save up for my baby, the pixel 8 pro?"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Even if the phone comes without the box  i will still buy it
bCSiFL3PdsA,Please can u do reviews on LG phones.
bCSiFL3PdsA,Also no protection of any kind to the screen.
bCSiFL3PdsA,What will happen if I buy Samsung a15 😢
bCSiFL3PdsA,But dude which  one  🤔 to pick among  them
bCSiFL3PdsA,I dont get this cancel u cnt be doing a review to make people buy and wen u dnt get likes u say dnt buy
bCSiFL3PdsA,Very true n sincere bro.!
bCSiFL3PdsA,"5 days ago, you gave 5 reasons you love the Samsung A25 🤔"
bCSiFL3PdsA,I have the a15 switching from the iPhone 8 plus and I like it a lot more it's better but yes I am comparing December 2023 phone to July 2017 phone lol
bCSiFL3PdsA,I wouldn't never pick tecno or infinix phone over Samsung. Their phones are full of bloatware the magically appears even though you didn't download them.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Awesome video, Tecno and infinix are really improving in what they offer but then. Yeah, brand name is at work when it comes to Samsung and this there A series phones. Unless its a hardcore Samsung fan. You get more from Tecno, infinix, redmi compared to Galaxy A10s and A20s"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Still a budget phone bro what more do u want
bCSiFL3PdsA,"A15 vs 15 Pro Max: the Samsung any time, at 1/10th the price, it is astonishing and offering stuff Apple can't fix. My top reasons for the A15: Tweakability, Less forced apps (you can bypass all Google crapware if you like, on Apple you sink in the stink of the iOS bundled app swamp), Firefox with Adblocker (hello Apple!), USB mass storage/fast charging, 3,5mm jack, SD card slot, fingerprint scanner in the on-switch and it feels as premium as the 15 Pro Max. The only dodgy thing is it tried to install Temu, Tik Tok and Candy Crush.... Guess they need some junk firms to pay the bill at Samsung. It was easily deleted though."
bCSiFL3PdsA,with samsung I feel its just the software that would make someone want to get this phone
bCSiFL3PdsA,I just got a Samsung a15 today
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Samsung is the best.
Forget Tecno"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Solid points, but samsung has a better and  more reliable software imo."
bCSiFL3PdsA,You need Jesus my guy not a Tecno
bCSiFL3PdsA,Cuidate mi hermano. Thank you for a great review.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"It's clear that Samsung doesn't give a damn about consumers in general and no charger in box tells alot. 
Even the Cheapest Samsung A05 doesn't have charger in the box 😂
I would also like to mention that I can no longer stand the ugly water drop notch and big bezels. 🤬"
bCSiFL3PdsA,If Tecno will keep their software up to date and good UI then I can consider
bCSiFL3PdsA,"A bit disappointed too especially with you, i bought this phone Samsung A25 after watching your review, shortly after  getting hold of it, its reality booms, you said the battery last you a day with 20% remain, my battery cannot even stand complete 6hrs with average usage, not to talk of its hotzone , to be sincere Samsung is just ripping us off with these their A series, pls go for S - series if you must buy Samsung phone this season"
bCSiFL3PdsA,Best is a10e or a14
bCSiFL3PdsA,I alwwys change my samsung phone every 3 year on my birthday. March 6... now im having a second thought on this A15.... and i dnt really F with techno tho 😢chai
bCSiFL3PdsA,5 month's ago you said you loved it and now you're saying to avoid it?😂
bCSiFL3PdsA,I have a question for u guys! Should i get the Samsung a15 or the Redmi Xiaomi 13c?
bCSiFL3PdsA,The A34 its way better than these two for the same price  as the A25 instead of the jack
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Looks like Samsung thinks that they're the IPhones of the Android world! 
They should simply discontinue making anything other than flag ship phones. 
I'd rather go for other brands that are already taking over their market worldwide."
bCSiFL3PdsA,Which phone do you recommend over A34/A25
bCSiFL3PdsA,these are good budget phones but I need some kind of water protection
bCSiFL3PdsA,"No charger and ""U"" shaped camera so i won't be buying it."
bCSiFL3PdsA,My opinion is he's not wrong but you should be able to check a box or something if you want the free case and you want to 25 watt fast charger you should have two boxes to check I understand some people don't need the charger other people want and need one especially if it's their first smartphone for their kid
bCSiFL3PdsA,SO YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE A HOLE IN YOUR SCREEN??? Please give me a notch every time. I would prefer you sacrifice 2 millimeters of screen than to put a hole in the middle of one. That is the equivalent of selling pants with holes already added.
bCSiFL3PdsA,Ill choose this phone compared to your techno phones.this phone will lasts for many years compared to techno phones and thats real value for money.the only Downside of this phone is that it has no charger in the box.
bCSiFL3PdsA,"At the price they're selling, no complaints for me. You get what you pay for. Want better phones with more features? Be prepared to pay for them.
Btw, I'm only talking about the SAMSUNG brand."
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Thick bezels dont bother me,althoug they could include a loader and mayby a backcase like asus did"
bCSiFL3PdsA,why weak net work in poor internat net work
bCSiFL3PdsA,Of course after buying it everyone says its not good like always
bCSiFL3PdsA,No headphone 🎧 no charger than there is no battery 🔋 in the phone 📱 and no phone in the box 😅 only name on the box 😅
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Every other samsung phone sucks for this simple reason: no Headphone jack, like wtf? trash!"
bCSiFL3PdsA,I can't say no to Samsung A15 LTE now it's selling below $100 in my country. 😊
bCSiFL3PdsA,I don know why people compare Samusng budget with tecno ...we still happy with samsung os .... Tecno is tecno 😂
bCSiFL3PdsA,I don't know why people hate dewdrop hole. I prefer it to punch hole and I hope Samsung budget phones keeps it
bCSiFL3PdsA,This video was just 🥰
bCSiFL3PdsA,Both phones will freeze  on u
bCSiFL3PdsA,And with Base
bCSiFL3PdsA,Abit disappointing?... more like highly dissatisfied
bCSiFL3PdsA,SAMSUNG still for the Win!
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung remains the best
bCSiFL3PdsA,So you hate my phone
bCSiFL3PdsA,"This guy's BS, he has another video called ""5 reasons to love the A25""! He's just making videos to get views not help people"
bCSiFL3PdsA,An a14 is kinda better
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung  was lazy by adding bad parts in phone
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Idk about A25
But A15 Is great device for me🔥"
bCSiFL3PdsA,"Software software software longevity, no buying 2 year trash"
bCSiFL3PdsA,I'm watching this on an A25😂
bCSiFL3PdsA,My a10e came  with box
bCSiFL3PdsA,They messed up
bCSiFL3PdsA,Samsung is still boss over iphone n tecno
bCSiFL3PdsA,I prefer a Samsung phone
bCSiFL3PdsA,Tecno never
