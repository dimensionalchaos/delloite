MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought this phone and it's crazy to me that this was a budget phone. I literally ordered it online, added a nice case and had it delivered in about 40 minutes... all for under $200 total. The amount of bang for your buck is pretty crazy and although I'm used to my iPad finger sensor location, I am really liking the feature built into the power button. Also, battery life matters to me and this is an upgrade over my last phone."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just got this phone. It's a very fast equipped phone when your on the go and in a fast pace environment. Like the fingerprint unlock feature is on point. The swiping on point too
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Let’s be honest, for most people this phone checks all the boxes."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review! I have upgraded my Samsung A12 on this because it has 5G. Man, Samsung is very durable. My A12 is still good after 3 years of use. You can never go wrong with Samsung!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,The phone to get for people who want the features that matter the most to most smartphone users without wanting to pay up to $1000 more for any of the S24 models. I'd buy it.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have been using it for 2 months. It's enough for most people.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got mine for $128 out the door from T-Mobile today. I have an iPhone 11 and the A15 5G is definitely an upgrade.
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15... Got her today... On my hand the most beautiful creature made by Samsung. Love it. 😊😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,"GSMARENA was my go to before the YouTube review era!!
Good to see you guys!!
Subbed!!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got this phone free when changing service and went from an A53 5G to this. I know the A53 has better specs but with day to day use they seem about the same. I'll probably go back to my A53 just because the camera is better but other than that it would be hard to tell them apart. I think the fingerprint reader is better on the A15 and it has an actual headphone jack so those even things out a little.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Great review. This A15 5G looks identical to my A25, but I am glad I bought the latter, the extra 50 bucks price difference seems to be worth it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just got it. Replacement for my overheated s21, its really good for a budget phone"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got one a month ago and it is the best bang for your buck. The display is 🔥
MP-aGSJJsvk,In video speaker test like the old days! Classic 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Galaxy A15 my dream phone 😍 cant wait to save money and buy this to play my favourite games, Pree Payyee and Pabjee Mobeel at 8k max settings 500fps wow"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I switched from S21 to this phone because of the longer battery, but it ticks all of the boxes I need for a phone. No need spending much and this phone doesnt need a cover"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I bought this phone just for my curiosity and it's pretty good aside from the meh camera quality. I own a Pixel 8 Pro and honestly this phone is pretty good for those on a very strict budget.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Most people using phones at this price range won't be needing the 5G speed, I appreciate the option thou, but getting the cheaper 4G model is probably the wiser choice."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought the Galaxy A15 a few days ago and so far I like it. It's probably too early to say for sure but so far it's a pretty good phone. I bought the Samsung galaxy A20 around 3 years ago and I loved it! Until the screen pixels crapped out on me after 2 or 3 months. I paid $80 to repair the screen and the new screen crappmonths. after 6 months. I was soon mad!!! 😂😭😠 So,  I'll wait past 6 months to see how this version really works for me. 😅😊"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Bought it yesterday and I'm in love with it perfect phone❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was attacked and robbed recently of my S24 Ultra and Switch OLED and 1800 in cash. Needless to say, I needed to shop for a new phone but was determined to get an OLED screen. I got the A15 LTE for $199 in Canada. What an incredible phone and value. The S24 Ultra is 2 grand in Canada and this phone keeps up nicely and had Android 14 installed. 
Im grateful that Samsung has a cheaper line of phones but also that they are making them so well. 
Everything about this phone is incredible for 2 hundred bucks.
Spring for the 5G model though. I should have thrown in the extra 25. My LTE is a little slow at times."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"It’s good to see Amoled screen on Samsung’s budget phones. However, I think I’m gonna wait for A55 if it has some interesting upgrade too."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Dear Samsung please get rid of this dam notch.Bring the punch hole in all of your devices.It is a humble request
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 User here. I'm super happy with it's recent updates, improving performance and so on."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Watching this on my Samsung A34. I love Samsung
MP-aGSJJsvk,Samsung did a good job for thier budget phones.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I love Samsung Galaxy A15 5G, I did some tests on it, didn't even break, I even poured water on it, didn't do ANY damage!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for this review. I had to buy one 4 days ago, when the screen of my device which i had for almost 4 years gave out. I actually really like it."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Updated comment: Guess the issue at 3:22 verifies Notebookcheck's test of the A15 LTE having better UFS controllers than the 5G version.

Original comment: Any other complaints that aren't based on skill issues?😂
Some website said the 4G version has faster storage speed despite both models being UFS 2.2."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This may be wrong of me to ask here but what about Angie? Like personally, are you guys still keep in touch with her? I know she moved on to start her own channel but she hasn't posted anything in a while. Both here and on her Instagram. I'm just worried about her. So please if you guys have any news, please share. Thank you."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I just bought it today as a toy for my daughter. I got it brand new for $40 from walmart. It is locked to straighttalk. But who cares I am not putting a sim in it, as it is going to be used as a gaming phone by kids."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Yay ive been waiting for this video
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I will buy this phone end of may, from A03 to A15.
The best budget phone between A05s & A25"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you so much Gsmarena
MP-aGSJJsvk,A15 is basically A24 in disguise
MP-aGSJJsvk,"A15 5G was released march 2023 herr in Phil. I bought mine march31 2023. .and I am very satisfied for the quality. My friends went crazy when I use this under the rain 🤣🤣🤣 until now nothing change, it seems like brand new when it comes to phone overl all performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Some corrections:
The A15 5G uses a different processer than the A15 4G. Both phones have OIS, not EIS, both phones get supported for 4 years OS updates, 5 years for security, and you can change the display colours on both devices,and both phones can take 50 mp photos for more detail which they didnt do in the camera test for some reason."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got mine yesterday and I really enjoy it. It's much faster than the a20 i had.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why is the Samsung A15 4G faster than the A15 5G when I always hear that 5G connectivity phones are faster ?
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got my Galaxy phone....loving it so far...
MP-aGSJJsvk,"My wife got this phone. A couple weeks in it started to get random issues locking up due to ghost touch, making the phone unusable until she restarts it. Seems to be a common issue online.

We're outside the 2 week return period, so now we need to try and bring it in the next time the issue shows up as they won't do anything unless they see the issue, but it happens sporadically and makes even restarting the phone difficult when it happens. A replacement might have the same issue so we were hoping to return the phone and go for a different model, but they said we have to go through warranty first.

Even the technician gave us a look the second he saw we had a A15 because he knew it was trouble.

Would not recommend this phone unless you don't mind your phone becoming unusable every once in a while."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Hey I have this phone just 2 days ago!
It was a really good phone and I am gonna use this phone for my school thats gonna start in 4 more days
Really shines and does more!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently just got the A15 4G
And I love it
I have no complains
It's fast and reliable.
I also play call of duty mobile with great frame rate and almost no lags
Tho lags are every endurable
It's the best budget phone I've ever used"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The one thing that I like about this phone and Samsung phones in general is the sound quality in videos, they sound pretty nice, my S20 FE captures sounds with great quality and I couldn't be more happier. This A15 has great quality sound in video as well."
MP-aGSJJsvk,THANK YOU SO MUCH 4 THE TOUR 😊
MP-aGSJJsvk,I got two for switching from Metro to T-mobile for free. They should be here Wed. Can't wait. My a12 is old and acting up and my daughter's A07 is definitely giving up the ghost; so prayerfully made the right choice.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Good review. Happy with my A15. Battery life is awesome.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I gave my daughter this phone hope she likes it❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,I saw a gunshop right across from your studio😂😂 5:29
MP-aGSJJsvk,Big fan of this video visual direction 🙏
MP-aGSJJsvk,Why are they still releasing a separate 5g and 4g version? 5g stopped being a premium (or even midrange) feature years ago.
MP-aGSJJsvk,My elder brother bought this for me 😊❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Saw her for one second and have never been happier to get her back with me
MP-aGSJJsvk,But how does it work as a telephone?
MP-aGSJJsvk,The best phone ever I switched from iphone and it's hands down the best phone I ever used people paying all this money for iphones and flagship phones doesn't make sense
MP-aGSJJsvk,"This phone impressed me! For an entry level, you can't go wrong with this!"
MP-aGSJJsvk,What a beauty 😍 i got mine last week 8gb 256gb rom 🎉
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got two of these phones for free with T-Mobile as a family plan and everyone satisfied I really like it
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I recently bought a Google Pixel 8 and bought an a15 for an emergency spare. The a15 does everything that the Google pixel 8 does, at least according to my needs (the camera on the Pixel 8 is better, however). I actually like the larger size of the a15, and for those who worry about the sturdiness of the case in the screen, you can get a rubberized case and screen covers for $10 or $15 total, making it hard to break. If I had to do it all over again, I would buy an a15 or an a25, and skip the pixel 8."
MP-aGSJJsvk,0:45 I’m here to watch the great review on this phone I just found at $100 dollars and with all due respect I started to watch this video and I was thinking about the “uncle Roger”guy lol😜I hope you don’t get offended by my dumb comment 😮
MP-aGSJJsvk,I've had a Galaxy A51 for a few years and I recently bought a A15 5g.I like it but my heart will always be with my A51 lol
MP-aGSJJsvk,Got the A15 a few weeks ago and it runs so well.  A big upgrade from my Moto G Pure.  I got tired of Moto.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"im buying this phone soon, my dad has a phone like that and it is very great. I suggest ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Thanks for the review: comprehensive, succinct, and interesting."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Nice review, many thanks. Apologies for my ignorance, but why would one need or prefer 4g vs 5g or vice versa? Thanks."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just got one and love it. I beat my addiction of apple
MP-aGSJJsvk,1:50 i dont understand some phone companies the flagships won't have headphone Jacks but their mid-range will just keep the headphone jack all together
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have a midrange a73 5g since 2022. I must say its still good and i heavily use my phone on a daily basis
MP-aGSJJsvk,Getting mine on Friday ❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Just bought this for my son. Hope he likes it
MP-aGSJJsvk,Even my 3yr old Redmi note 9pro max doesn't lag
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Just bought it, nice🎉"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Great Phone i recently buy this and very smooth runing
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Brought 4G of  this phone two weeks ago 160$ 6GB RAM and 128GB of ROM

PROS ARE
1 Amoled display but compared to other phones like even galaxy s8 it looks little cheap idk why. 
2 Battery is perfect it consume 10% every hour of screen time
3 One UI 6 is pretty good with no lag.
4 fingerprint scanner is very responsive and very fast i love it.

Cons 
1 No HDR support for display.

2 bulky design and applying case and screen protector make it very heavy.

3 No OIS or EIS for camera. And 50mp photos looks washed out front camera is taking good photos but looks unnatural.

4 phone back is plastic and fingerprint marks are very visible. After wiping it several times tiny scratches was visible which is not good. I applied plastic protection in the back to solve further scratches.

5 Front screen have no protection its normal glass I was very sad that it didn't have any type of glass  protection. So I applied screen protector to keep it safe."
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just want to use the phone for doing deliveries like doordash and Uber eats. Don't care about the photos.
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I got this phone i like it was tottalu worth ot with my laptop and it can gp up to 2k ""1440p"" Resluton. Its totally worth it especially While play games or also video edit 2k at 60  and its Smooth and its cool. :)"
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I was looking for a s24, and the shopkeeper handed over A15 and s24, and i was surprised both of them looked same almost and similar features except the camera  quality (which i dont use) but with an enormous price difference."
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you for this review. I found it most helpful. Gale
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Watching from my A15 and I must say, it's just so good for its price"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Nice. I you bought this phone as a back up for $40 bucks✊🏼
MP-aGSJJsvk,The Samsung A15 5G 256GB is on my shopping list. I currently own the Samsung A15 4G 128GB. I use the Samsung A15 4G 128GB as a editing photography tool.  I intend to use both versions of the Samsung A15 phones as editing tablets on the go as I will put 512GB SD Card in both alongside my Redmi Pad SE  128GB tablet I also intend to purchase both the Samsung A25 5G 256GB and Samsung A25 4G 256GB and Redmi Pad Pro 256GB for my editing
MP-aGSJJsvk,For what ive read its 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security patches.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have recently bought the Samsung AO5s and Samsung A15 4G.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you gsm
MP-aGSJJsvk,"it is very decent, perfect for daily light/moderate use. I love the battery performance."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"i got this to replace my redmi 8 pro as the battery was dying. great phone, feels solid, camera is not as good as only 30fps but that doesnt bother me. has all the bells and whisltles like NFC. cant fault it for a £100 phone ❤"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I just shattered my 21ultra so i think im gumna pull the trigger on this budget phone for a while
MP-aGSJJsvk,The beat device I've ever bought 🎉❤❤❤
MP-aGSJJsvk,Thank you much for the info.
MP-aGSJJsvk,Your nerdy ness helped me
MP-aGSJJsvk,This is a very nice phone for the money. I like the knock on and off feature as well.
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have this phone for 1 Mos now and I love it
MP-aGSJJsvk,"Bought this today after broke My 4 year old a15. It's not spectacular, but i loved that phone, and this feels like a direct upgrade.  The main downside is the camera, but i already had a shit camera, so there's not much to complain about."
MP-aGSJJsvk,i have this phone 6gb ram... I love it. huge performance difference compared to 4gb
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I bought this phone as i lost my  A12 which had a great camera.and the wide angle shots were good. Hoping for a better camera , the A15's is very disappointing, and the ultra wide mode produces appalling blurry shots even in good light and with really poor results. Not what i was expecting from Samsung when my A12 camera was better by miles. Very disappointed."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"The A15 5G is not slower because it's a 5G model, it's because there was a firmware and software issue. This has now been fixed by Samsung."
MP-aGSJJsvk,"I never buy  super expensive  phones, as i tend to brake them all the time i dont do anything fancy or special with it im on my 3rd phone this year i work out side i get on machines and ladders trucks  etc  and thats why i get phones just like this one, im on my day number 5 and i love it!! I paid 350bucks with  screen protector and the case  with 2 years warranty 😊SUPER"
MP-aGSJJsvk,Which is better to buy A15 4g or A15 5g
MP-aGSJJsvk,"for 100 bucks it does the job, has a nice screen and is passible for a fill in phone"
MP-aGSJJsvk,I have A15 i switched upgraded to Samsung galaxy S25
