My only gripe is that it is battery life won't last two days if you do a lot of media, but it's night and day difference from the A14 5g.
By the way , I feel you should have reviewed the four gigabyte model , as this is what most people will end up with !"
6Dhi-z-BHmE,I bought the A25 5g last week. I'm still waiting for you to review it. It might be Europe's most popular smartphone this year.
6Dhi-z-BHmE,"1:24 Can you also compare the A15 to the A24?

6:04 If your region got the Exynos 1330 variant of the A14 5G, then the performance is a slight downgrade."
6Dhi-z-BHmE,"""Unfortunately it has a water drop notch"" lol that's a u shaped notch not waterdrop and nothing wrong with that, better than an ugly hole in the middle of the screen. I hate both actually and miss the bezels, nothing beats that. This phone is decent but the A25 is a better buy. That's the one I'm gonna get."
6Dhi-z-BHmE,When will the Samsung Galaxy A55 5G come out?
6Dhi-z-BHmE,I wouldn't mind if they deleted the 2mp macro to make the ultra wide better.
6Dhi-z-BHmE,"Great review, they sleep on your channel."
6Dhi-z-BHmE,Does a Samsung A24 on Amazon for $179.00 sound like a better deal to you ?
6Dhi-z-BHmE,Is it a dual Sim model?
6Dhi-z-BHmE,Im getting this phone next month A15 5g Samsung by boost mobile
