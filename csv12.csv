VDwxEagh188,"I bought this phone Samsung A15  about a month ago'  and i have to say this is a great phone, its fast has a lot or storage and a great battery, like the screen very nice and has  great sound, love the ( yellow color)  two people in my family and my friend bought this same phone this week and they really like it,  We all enjoy this phone glad we purchased it."
VDwxEagh188,"I just purchased my Samsung A15 a month ago, trying to get adjusted to it, coming from a iPhone.  I like it, love the features. very nice"
VDwxEagh188,I can't wait a little bit longer to have this galaxy A15 5g..i really admire it
VDwxEagh188,"Still here Salute. I bought this phone today at BB for memorial day and after unboxing I really like this phone. Looks solid, nice phone and love the fact that today when plugged in for first time to charge I love the fact that it shows battery life and charging time stays on."
VDwxEagh188,"That's what I'm going to buy. I don't like poco and redmi, my friend's poco x6 pro was thrown away because it turned off suddenly while playing games. Samsung legit is still good."
VDwxEagh188,"As phones keep getting expensive, I ended up getting this phone recently and loving it so far. The only downside was that it does not have always on display but other than that happy with my purchase."
VDwxEagh188,I ordered the a15 5g from Straight talk last week. Picked up one for me and one for my brother for $87 for 2 since it was free with the $45 monthly plan. At that price I figured it would totally be worth it. Waiting on it to arrive on Thursday.
VDwxEagh188,I ordered mone today and I know im going to love it.
VDwxEagh188,"Loving my a15 5g. Seems to be a little bit slower than my a14 5g,but not a big deal considering all that is on this phone. The size and design fits my hand so much better than the a14 5g."
VDwxEagh188,"I""m still here when come to samsung phones i like is the software & security updates i do own one of this phone myself 😍✌️"
VDwxEagh188,Just letting people know you can boost the volume without using a sound booster. It called media volume limit. I will put up a description of f how to do it if people are unable to do it. 🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,This phone is great ! I bought it in September 2024 and I can say that I like it! I really like your video posts and they helped me a lot to optimize this phone. Thank you very much!
VDwxEagh188,"I swapped my old Iphone 7 plus to this. I only add Php3000. 
I love it."
VDwxEagh188,Awesome review. I got this phone. I love it
VDwxEagh188,im still here :) i have this phone liking it so far x
VDwxEagh188,"I love this phone as I bought it thinking it had three Card Slots like the Samsung A10 and Samsung A05S. But unfortunately not. So I have bought the Samsung AO5s and have decided to use the Samsung A15 4G as a Street Photography editing tablet with a Samsung  512 GB SD Card inside.

I must admit both the Samsung A24 4G  and Samsung A25 5G 256GB are also on my to purchase list.
The Samsung A15 5G with 256GB is also on my list and perhaps the Samsung A16 5G depending on what they so with it"
VDwxEagh188,"I agree with below comments - very happy with this phone. Admittedly I only do very basic stuff, but it works fast, effectively. I was lucky - got mine for £123.99 and a friend set it up for me. I dont use ""stuff"", so out of that window. But its works fine. Oddly I get no signal in a local supermarket where everyone else does... must be a frequency thing... other than that - fine."
VDwxEagh188,"i bought this coz of your reviews. i use this as a secondary phone to my Galaxy A34 5G.

yes i also have the February security patch. i got the 8/256GB variant. it has only the hybrid SIM tray in our country. and so far i love using my A15 5G. it has no problems. everything is very good for the price. i have no problems with it."
VDwxEagh188,This device is kinda like the J7 or J7 prime on steroids!!!!!
VDwxEagh188,"3.5 mm Jack,Cheap,Great battery,Oled Display..Sir,take my money and give me that phone"
VDwxEagh188,Ur so lucky to have all those apps. Mine can’t handle all that
VDwxEagh188,Excellent comprehensive review.
VDwxEagh188,"Is fast and also  use it as a music bank,and photo bank."
VDwxEagh188,Its a great phone
VDwxEagh188,Im using it as my daily phone its great
VDwxEagh188,I’m still here
VDwxEagh188,Planned obsolescence just like that every other phone without a user replaceable battery.
VDwxEagh188,"Hey what stand are you using to film the phone? It looks cool! Send a link please, super interested!"
VDwxEagh188,"Do you have the 4G version to compare with? And do these thing reload backgrounded apps a lot?
My lg with 8gb started refreshing apps sent to background as the updates came along. It sucks."
VDwxEagh188,"You just earned yourself a new subscriber.

I love your honest review.

Can this Phone do Front and Back video recording at same time?"
VDwxEagh188,Great review bro got a question for you does this have Smart view for screen mirroring to the tv 🤔
VDwxEagh188,I have the phone and seems like it's a decent phone. On Wifi it's like smooth butter but on the 5g network data it's so damn slow and just turns and buffers most of the damn time! I called boostmobile and i seem to have good coverage but this phone is so slow. And unfortunately it's impossible to be on Wifi all the time. I really wanna throw the phone out the window!!! 🙄😬
VDwxEagh188,"I recently saw one of these Samsung A15 5g phones in my local Walmart and I was impressed with this screen quality and the build too.  How would you say performance in regards to multitasking holds up?  Also, do those matte screen protectors make a difference with the phone out in direct sunlight?  I enjoy content on the budget devices to see what they’re capable of, keep up the great content!"
VDwxEagh188,"Thanks for a great comprehensive review! Believe it or not I bought the Samsung J320A back when it came out, I believe that was 2016 and that is the phone I am still using, I have a mini sd card in it so glad to know I can use that card to access my data from the A15. I need to update because I'm getting messages from programs that I use that my phone can't update to their latest version. The A15 is the one I am considering. I'm wondering if I take my sim card from my J320A and put it in the A15 will I then have the same phone number and plan that I have with my A320J? I have ATT prepaid."
VDwxEagh188,I purchased 2 …. I from Tracfone  for about $130.00 and one from Ebay for $65.00 both new in box . They replace the  two A 12 and are capable of of running some apps  the A12 will not ( Samsung Smartthings for one ) one phone will be getting the 256 gb SD card from the old phone for pictures videos and music it will be used as external storage .
VDwxEagh188,"planning to have a15 this month, is it dual sim?"
VDwxEagh188,i have a question i bought this phone everything is good but i am facing issue with its proximity sensor its screen do not switch off when i take the phone to ear and also when i play the voice note in whatsapp its screen don't switch off and also voice comes from loud speaker when i take to my ear
VDwxEagh188,"I am buy this phone tomorrow, if they use the virtual ram for background processes and the physical ram is not being used for that then its already good. N1 killer on smartphones are the background apps running. If you have a LCD screen like me and going to super Amoled, then the screen is going to be God tier and it has a good camera for me coming from a Nokia G20. The Nokia G20 that I have has sometimes artifacting in the instagram and youtube shorts, can't watch 720p 60fps video without lagging and on some objects the camera does not focus. Nokia G20 is not a bad phone, it's software is not good. I don't blame the hardware, but I always blame the software."
VDwxEagh188,I bought mine 6 months ago and now the screen has frozen and I can't use it?
VDwxEagh188,"Are sure that ram plus boost it to 8gb? , i only see 4"
VDwxEagh188,Could you please name the case you are using again I'm unable to find it. I need that case. 😁🇬🇧👍
VDwxEagh188,Is this phone better than the A52s 5G?
VDwxEagh188,My only concern with this phone is camera quality... How good is the camera guys? Especially compared to the Redmi Note 13
VDwxEagh188,"From 150$ to 200$ There are other better phone like cmf, m35, z9s. I this like z9s for dyanamic range in images. Cmf for like design. M35 is overall best in price segment but performance could have been better.
Suggest me some if you know better mobile."
VDwxEagh188,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

VDwxEagh188,But i am facing problem like its draining 2x faster than normal playing of 5 to 6 min of utube consumes exactly 1% every time any solution for this...?
VDwxEagh188,This phone takes good pictures in the back but the selfie camera is not as crispy and detailed like the back camera is doing I just got this phone 3 days ago and I like everything about it except the selfie camera I have a Huawei p30 lite and the selfie camera is 34mp and takes really good detail pictures in the back and front and I paid 200 something for that one and I paid 200 something for the new galaxy a15 but that selfie camera is not it
VDwxEagh188,Boss
