iP0QW7WEyr0,"I think we got a worthy competitor with the Samsung Galaxy A35 ... the OnePlus Nord 4 (metal body) powered by the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 SoC, sport a 6.74"" 1.5K 120Hz OLED screen, a 5,500 mAh battery with 100W charging support. It will have three cameras - 50MP primary, 8MP ultrawide, and 16MP selfie. An in-display fingerprint scanner, stereo speakers and we both know more will be revealed next week [no doubt an Android OS 14 which will be very Color OS ]."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Thank you so much for this, I have just bought one of these phones and used your videos to set up and put in place a lot of these great suggestions. This is my first smart phone and I am a pensioner in the UK. This has been so clear and understandable, I am happily using it. Could not have done it without your videos, a thousand thank yous."
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thanks this was very helpful because I just picked up a Galaxy A15
iP0QW7WEyr0,"battery protection & ""lift to wake"" are very cool ☆ thanks 👍
nb:
can add screenshot button in notification panel
~ swipe down for panel & select edit
& select screenshot button as one of top six."
iP0QW7WEyr0,Bought the A15 today so satisfied with it today 🎭
iP0QW7WEyr0,One thing I noticed is; the widgets on the bottom corners of your lock screen can be changed or removed. Hold down on the lock screen and you will have the option to customize them. I removed the left one and set the right one to turn on and off my flashlight without unlocking the phone.
iP0QW7WEyr0,Bro this phone is awesome !! I recently got one
iP0QW7WEyr0,Switch of animation makes the phone faster as well.
iP0QW7WEyr0,"to screenshot with ""palm"" more like your whole hand really is take your whole hand on the left of the screen with your hands far right side on the left side not top or bottom just the left side, and swipe firmly from left to right holding hand almost off the left edge to start, pretty easy after a couple tries.."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"I just got one of these thank you for the great video. I hate having to learn new things in my old age but my other phone was six years old and wasn't working right and of course the company had no clue why. Well I finally did, it was just to old and there wasn't any more updates for that Android phone. Hahaha!"
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Already having A15 5G. Great phone, very satisfied"
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Thanks, this was super helpful"
iP0QW7WEyr0,I just got my A15 tonight definitely using these tricks and tips🎉
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Thank you for this!  I just got my A15 Saturday and was having a time with the features!  I am coming from the Samsung S20 and it is a bit different!  Question, on the S20 I was able to assign a tone to each of my family members so that I would know which one was texting or calling!  I can't seem to figure it on the A15?"
iP0QW7WEyr0,A15 4g here. 0:10
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thanks for sharing. A got lot of knowledge because of your  blog thanks
iP0QW7WEyr0,THANK YOU !! Im old and I just got this phone! and I'm locking it..HEAVY AF as well. lol
iP0QW7WEyr0,RAM+ in my experience makes my A53 5G laggy so I turned it off. My biggest gripe with Samsung is Samsung keeps installing apps on my phone I can't uninstall.
iP0QW7WEyr0,Two points are important number 1 either it should charge full in 10 to 20 min If not 2 It should last 24 hours min Onscreen Time
iP0QW7WEyr0,Good video bro but has anyone had screen delay freeze or so ...or its just bc screen protection glass?it happend to me every time i use to play a game?
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thanks for the swipe gesture instead of button type and the colour font 🎉
iP0QW7WEyr0,Best phone I've ever had. Glad I purchased it
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thanks for showing the tip about protecting your battery! I sometimes fall asleep with my phone charging. I can be assured now that my phone will only go up to 80% Much appreciated!
iP0QW7WEyr0,"This video was so useful, very well explained. I just upgraded to a samsung a15. I never knew about most of these features."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"Ram plus, ""if you don't want this on for whatever reason""? 
what reason, I still have no idea if I should have it on or not.
these tips are more useful for a 14 yr old."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"I am quite tech savvy, but this guy is going way too fast. Just because he knows what he’s doing, doesn’t mean the rest of us do."
iP0QW7WEyr0,"New to your channel & thank the GOD'S you are here!!! They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks!! Thank you kindly 🙏 DEFINITELY Subbed 😊 (I'm struggling with the ""Screenshot"" if you could help I'd be eternally grateful!) All I've managed to accomplish is a fuzzy screen lol"
iP0QW7WEyr0,"you forgot the edge panel, I found it pretty cool too 😊"

iP0QW7WEyr0,"Ever since I got my a15, the youtube app would just act like I've closed it and opened it after backing out of it to go into another app even though I have youtube premium so it should still play in the background. Are there any fixes for this?"
iP0QW7WEyr0,Thank you
iP0QW7WEyr0,How do I get that search bar that you have on your main screen. I have to scroll through a couple screens to find mine and it's got all the history and everything below that which I don't like. I just got this phone I had the Samsung AO3 ES which this is a big step up. But it's taken me days to change things on it that I'm not used to. Like on the keyboard part I like to use talk to text and the microphone is at the bottom instead of the top were the Emojis are. Thank you for this I will watch it in its entirety later.
iP0QW7WEyr0,"It might be stupid but, when im in an app and i hit the home button and go to  another app for a moment and then either open up my recently used apps or hit the home button and go back go the app i was using it reloaded my entire progress, as if i (where filling out an application or retrieving a security code from my email) it reboots me to the beginning of the app or progress is lost from what i was doing..."
